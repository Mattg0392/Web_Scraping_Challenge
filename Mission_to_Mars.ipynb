The tubes are also the product of extreme cleanliness standards. All of NASA\\'s planetary missions involve exacting processes to prevent the introduction of Earthly organic, inorganic, and biological material. But since these tubes could hold proof that life once existed elsewhere in the universe, the Mars 2020 team needed to reduce &ndash; even further &ndash; the possibility that they could host Earthly artifacts that could complicate the scientific process. The mandate was essentially that nothing should be in a tube until the Sample Caching System begins filling it with 9 cubic inches (147 cubic centimeters) of Jezero Crater (about the size of a piece of chalk).</p>\\n\\n<p>\"And when they said \\'nothing,\\' they meant it,\" said Ian Clark, the mission\\'s assistant project systems engineer for sample tube cleanliness at JPL. \"An example: To achieve the kind of science the mission is going after, we needed to limit the total amount of Earth-based organic compounds in a given sample to less than 150 nanograms. For a set of particular organic compounds &ndash; ones that are very indicative of life &ndash; we were limited to less than 15 nanograms in a sample.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>A nanogram is a billionth of a gram. An average thumbprint carries about 45,000 nanograms of organics &ndash; about 300 times the total allowed in a sample tube. To meet such stringent mission specifications, the team had to rewrite the book on cleaning.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We did all our assembly in a hyper-clean-room environment, which is essentially a clean room inside a clean room,\" said Clark. \"Between assembly steps, the sample tubes would be cleaned with filtered air blasts, rinsed with deionized water, and sonically cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and other exotic cleaning agents.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After each cleaning, the team would measure contaminants and bake the tubes for good measure. By the time the 43 sample tubes were selected from a field of 93 fabricated for flight, each had generated over 250 pages of documentation and 3 gigabytes of images and videos.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of the tubes aboard Perseverance, up to 38 are destined to be filled with Martian rock and regolith. The other five are \"witness tubes\" that have been loaded with materials geared to capture molecular and particulate contaminants. They\\'ll be opened one at a time on Mars to witness the ambient environment primarily near sample collection sites, cataloging any Earthly impurities or contaminants from the spacecraft that may be present during sample collection.</p>\\n\\n<p>The the sample and witness tubes\\' eventual return to and examination on Earth will allow the full breadth of terrestrial science laboratory capabilities to investigate the samples, using instruments too large and complex to send to Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>More About the Mission</b></p>\\n\\n<p>A key objective of Perseverance\\'s mission on Mars is <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">astrobiology</a>, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life.

NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Mars 2020</a> Perseverance rover launched in July and is set to land on the Red Planet Feb. 18, 2021. The car-size rover will search for signs of ancient microbial life. Using a coring drill at the end of its robotic arm, Perseverance has the capability to gather samples of Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust) and hermetically seal them in collection tubes. Perseverance can deposit these samples at designated locations on the Martian surface or store them internally.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the next steps of the MSR campaign, NASA and ESA will provide respective components for a Sample Retrieval Lander mission and an Earth Return Orbiter mission, with launches planned in the latter half of this decade. The Sample Retrieval Lander mission will deliver a Sample Fetch Rover and Mars Ascent Vehicle to the surface of Mars. The rover will retrieve the samples and transport them to the lander. The Perseverance rover also provides a potential capability for delivery of collection tubes to the lander. A robotic arm on the lander will transfer the samples into a container embedded in the nose of the Mars Ascent Vehicle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Once sealed, the system will prepare for the first launch from another planet. In Mars orbit, the Earth Return Orbiter will rendezvous with and capture the sealed sample container, and then place the samples in an additional high-reliability containment capsule for return to Earth in the early 2030s.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Returning samples of Mars to Earth has been a goal of planetary scientists since the early days of the space age, and the successful completion of this MSR key decision point is an important next step in transforming this goal into reality,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"MSR is a complex campaign, and it encapsulates the very essence of pioneering space exploration &ndash; pushing the boundaries of what\\'s capable and, in so doing, furthering our understanding of our place in the universe.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Bringing Mars samples back to Earth will allow scientists across the world to examine the specimens using sophisticated instruments too large and too complex to send to Mars, and will allow future generations to study them using technology not yet available. Curating the samples on Earth will allow the science community to test new theories and models as they are developed, much as the Apollo samples returned from the Moon have done for decades.</p>\\n\\n<div data-react-class=\"Video\" data-react-props=\"{\"files\":[{\"file\":\"/system/video_items/5908_mars_sample_return_20200210-640.m4v\"}],\"vtt_files\":[],\"caption\":\"\\\\u003cb\\\\u003eNASA Advances Plans to Bring Samples Back From Mars\\u200b\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e\\\\u003cspan\\\\u003e\\\\u003cb\\\\u003e:\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e Collecting samples from Mars and bringing them back to Earth is a historic undertaking that starts with the launch of NASA\\\\u0026#39;s Mars 2020 rover.

A little more than one Martian year later, the stationary lander has detected more than 480 quakes and collected the most comprehensive weather data of any surface mission sent to Mars. InSight\\'s probe, which has struggled to dig underground to take the planet\\'s temperature, has <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8776/nasa-insights-mole-is-out-of-sight/?site=insight\">made progress</a>, too.</p>\\n\\n<p>There was a time when the surfaces of Mars and Earth were very similar. Both were warm, wet, and shrouded in thick atmospheres. But 3 or 4 billion years ago, these two worlds took different paths. The mission of InSight (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) has been to help scientists to compare Earth to its rusty sibling. Studying what the depths of Mars is made of, how that material is layered, and how quickly heat seeps out of it could help scientists better understand how a planet\\'s starting materials make it more or less likely to support life.</p>\\n\\n<p>While there\\'s more science to come from InSight, here are three findings about our red neighbor in the sky.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Faint Rumblings Are the Norm</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight\\'s seismometer, which was provided by the French space agency, Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES), is sensitive enough to detect slight rumblings from great distances. But it wasn\\'t until April 2019 that seismologists with the Marsquake Service, coordinated by ETH Zurich, <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8430/nasas-insight-detects-first-likely-quake-on-mars/?site=insight\">detected their first marsquake</a>. Since then, Mars has more than made up for lost time by shaking frequently, albeit gently, with no quakes larger than magnitude 3.7.</p>\\n\\n<p>The lack of quakes larger than magnitude 4 poses something of a mystery, considering how frequently the Red Planet shakes due to smaller quakes.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s a little surprising we haven\\'t seen a bigger event,\" said seismologist Mark Panning of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the InSight mission. \"That may be telling us something about Mars, or it may be telling us something about luck.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Put another way: It could be that Mars is just more static than anticipated &ndash; or that InSight landed in an especially quiet period.</p>\\n\\n<p>Seismologists will have to keep waiting patiently for those larger quakes in order to study layers deep below the crust. \"Sometimes you get big flashes of amazing information, but most of the time you\\'re teasing out what nature has to tell you,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. \"It\\'s more like trying to follow a trail of tricky clues than having the answers presented to us in a nicely wrapped-up package.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Wind May Hide Quakes</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Once InSight started detecting quakes, they became so regular that, at one point, they were happening every day. Then, in late June of this year, the detections essentially stopped. Only five quakes have been detected since then, all of them since September.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25325/insight-on-mars-illustration/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\"NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft with its instruments deployed on the Martian surface\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25325_PIA22743-16.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>InSight on Mars (Illustration): </b>NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft with its instruments deployed on the Martian surface.

The mission knew that winds could affect InSight\\'s sensitive <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/seis/\">seismometer</a>, which is equipped with <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8407/insights-seismometer-now-has-a-cozy-shelter-on-mars/?site=insight\">a domed wind and heat shield</a>. But the wind still shakes the ground itself and creates literal noise that covers up quakes. This could also have contributed to what seems like the long seismic silence before InSight\\'s first quake, since the spacecraft landed while a regional dust storm was settling down.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Before landing, we had to guess at how the wind would affect surface vibrations,\" Banerdt said. \"Since we\\'re working with events that are much smaller than what we\\'d pay attention to on Earth, we find that we have to pay much closer attention to the wind.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Surface Waves Are Missing</b></p>\\n\\n<p>All quakes have two sets of body waves, which are waves that travel through the planet\\'s interior: primary waves (P-waves) and secondary waves (S-waves). They also ripple along the top of the crust as part of a third category, called surface waves.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Earth, seismologists use surface waves to learn more about the planet\\'s internal structure. Before getting to Mars, InSight\\'s seismologists expected these waves to offer glimpses as deep as 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) below the surface, into a sub-crustal layer called the mantle. But Mars continues to offer mysteries: Despite hundreds of quakes, none has included surface waves.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s not totally unheard of to have quakes without surface waves, but it has been a surprise,\" Panning said. \"For instance, you can\\'t see surface waves on the Moon. But that\\'s because the Moon has far more scattering than Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The dry lunar crust is more fractured than Earth and Mars, causing seismic waves to bounce around in a more diffuse pattern that can last for over an hour. The lack of surface waves on Mars may be linked to extensive fracturing in the top 6 miles (10 kilometers) below InSight. It could also mean that the quakes InSight detected are coming from deep within the planet, since those wouldn\\'t produce strong surface waves.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, untangling such mysteries is what science is all about, and there\\'s more to come with InSight.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>More About the Mission</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA\\'s Discovery Program, managed by the agency\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supports spacecraft operations for the mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>A number of European partners, including France\\'s Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), are supporting the InSight mission. CNES provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument to NASA, with the principal investigator at IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris). Significant contributions for SEIS came from IPGP; the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Switzerland; Imperial College London and Oxford University in the United Kingdom; and JPL. DLR provided the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>) instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland.

Voyager had recently encountered Saturn, and the Lab was crawling with members of the media.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was like walking into a football stadium in the middle of the touchdown. It was electric,\" he says. \"This is something that doesn\\'t go on anywhere else in the world, and to be immersed in it with your first footsteps was crazy. That alone was awe-inspiring.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Cut to 2020, and the veteran mechanical engineer has been with JPL for more than 35 years. As someone who\\'s often tapped to be part of high-stakes problem-solving \"tiger teams,\" he\\'s worked as the systems design lead for the Mars Exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">soon-to-land Mars Perseverance rover</a> &ndash; each mission more challenging than the last.</p>\\n\\n<p>The size of a small SUV, Curiosity dwarfed Spirit and Opportunity, landing via the mind-boggling \"sky crane\" maneuver, in which a descent stage lowers the rover onto Mars. With Perseverance, the team had to \"grow the rover\" more, Allen says, to accommodate a whole new suite of instruments and the intricate system the rover will rely on to take samples from Mars and deposit them in tubes for a future mission to return to Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We took on the most complicated mission we\\'ve ever done while we\\'re changing our infrastructure,\" he says. \"This is like fixing your car while you\\'re driving it.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mechanical Mindset</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While Allen\\'s initiation at JPL may have been dizzying, his high school years were hardly a foreshadowing of the success to come. \"The first two years of high school, I was never in the mindset of what I wanted to do,\" he says.</p>\\n\\n<p>Allen grew up in West Los Angeles, the middle child of five siblings. His mother was a child development specialist, and his father owned and operated a landscaping business. In his youth, he was \"always tinkering with things,\" Allen says. \"I would take apart anything and everything. Whatever my parents gave me, such as bikes, I demolished. I would take it apart, modify it, make it better.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>It was only at the end of his junior year that Allen began thinking about life after high school. That\\'s when he decided to study engineering. But there was lost ground to cover. \"Most students had already decided,\" he says. \"They had taken much more advanced math and were further along than me, so I took summer classes to catch up.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Allen wound up at JPL only by serendipity. His uncle, who worked at JPL in electronic packaging, saw a job listing for the Lab\\'s mailroom and suggested his nephew apply as a way to earn extra money the summer before college. \"I didn\\'t even know what JPL was,\" Allen says.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25458/allen-with-engineering-models-in-the-mars-yard/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Bill Allen with engineering models in the Mars Yard\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25458_E1-BIll-Allen-early-2000s-cap-16.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b><span>Bill Allen with engineering models in the Mars Yard: </span></b>Bill Allen with engineering models of the (clockwise from bottom) Sojourner rover, a Mars Exploration Rover, and Curiosity in JPL\\'s Mars Yard in the early 2000s. <a href=\"/resources/25458/allen-with-engineering-models-in-the-mars-yard/\">Download image &rsaquo;</a>\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p><b>Challenges Accepted</b></p>\\n\\n<p>But he was a quick learner. Early in the mornings, he would sort the mail, then jump into the mailroom\\'s Jeep and deliver throughout the day on JPL\\'s sprawling grounds. (This was before the days of email and there was, he says, a <i>lot </i>of mail.) That was all he needed: \"When I saw what was going on here that first summer, I wanted to come back.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>That fall, Allen left to study engineering physics at Oregon State University, but he landed a spot two years later in a new program at JPL: a six-month co-op &ndash; similar to today\\'s internship program &ndash; with 20 other students. \"It was quite frankly amazing,\" he says of the experience. \"We were treated like assets.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The co-op included weekly field trips, such as visits to Edwards Air Force Base to watch shuttle launches, booster tests, and experimental crash landings. It wasn\\'t unusual for an astronaut or lead scientist to drop in for a talk with the students.</p>\\n\\n<p>Students were also assigned hands-on tasks that were integral to the flight hardware and that spurred creative thinking. Allen helped to redesign <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/galileo/overview/\">Galileo</a>\\'s mounting for its star scanner, which uses the position of stars to help the spacecraft navigate.</p>\\n\\n<p>After his co-op ended, Allen would return to JPL to spend all his school holidays co-oping. When Allen graduated in 1986, he had an offer waiting for him: a full-time position at JPL as a mechanical design engineer.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Making History, Breaking Records</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Allen dove headfirst into major tasks early on at JPL, such as the development of the 70-meter Deep Space Network antenna and 34-meter waveguide beam designs, as well as mission support for Galileo. He wound up working on <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/\">Cassini</a> for 10 years, seeing it through the design cycle from start to finish.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It was very fulfilling to work on a dedicated project,\" he says, calling Cassini \"the last of the old-school projects,\" where the design of a major mission could take 10 or more years.</p>\\n\\n<p>Allen soon found himself with the near-impossible job of helping to design a rover that would fit inside the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-pathfinder-sojourner-rover/\">Mars Pathfinder</a> lander and then unfold itself on Mars. And it needed to be designed in record time: three years.</p>\\n\\n<p>To meet the deadline, the team pitched reusing the architecture of Mars Pathfinder, which had successfully landed and deployed the first Mars rover, Sojourner, in July 1997. Not only did NASA end up selecting their proposal, but also requesting two rovers &ndash; what would become the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/overview/\">Mars Exploration Rovers</a> Spirit and Opportunity.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"There are not many times when you\\'re given what you\\'ve asked,\" he recalls. \"In this case, it was, \\'Oh, you want <i>two </i>of them? OK, here we go.\\'\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Over the next three years, a team of managers, engineers, and technicians pushed through high stress levels and around-the-clock work schedules to complete the rovers, an experience Allen describes as one of the most challenging &ndash; and rewarding &ndash; endeavors he\\'s taken on.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Those rovers had my blood, tears, soul, and DNA,\" Allen says. \"To have them touch down on another planet was as surreal as it gets.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Quantum Leaps and Tiger Teams</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While those twin Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) tested JPL\\'s ability to produce a rover in a short time period, the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a> rover &ndash; originally known as Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) &ndash; came with its own challenges.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Going from MER to MSL was a quantum leap,\" Allen says. \"MER was re-cooked from Pathfinder, but MSL was as close to a clean slate as you can get. We knew how to design rovers, but this one was going to be much bigger and do much more.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, a clean slate meant a whole new slate of problems. Well after the design implementation, the team learned that there was an unexpected issue with the exhaust plume from the thrusters used during descent and landing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mission set up a \"tiger team\" to find a solution and asked Allen to join. \"When a problem arises on a mission,\" he explains, \"they put together a team of highly focused individuals; it\\'s cross-talent. Those are always the ones I enjoy the most.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Over the next year and a half, the tiger team met \"anywhere and everywhere\" to understand the problem, trade concepts to solve the problem, and then to validate the concepts.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Mars in 2014, after the MSL descent stage lowered Curiosity with cables onto the surface of Mars via the sky crane maneuver, Allen remembers the feeling of awe that it all worked out.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We looked at everything we had done and thought, \\'This is the craziest thing we\\'ve done so far.\\' It was super-challenging, all the things that had to come together to make this work.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Allen watched the landing from Beckman Auditorium at Caltech, which manages JPL for NASA. \"There were a lot of tears,\" he recalls. \"I was with the people I spent time in the trenches with to take in the landing, and you could tell everybody had the same reactions &ndash; it was deeper than words can provide.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Persevering</b></p>\\n\\n<p>After being part of JPL\\'s most historic Mars explorers, Allen felt ready to find challenges beyond rovers. But then he learned more about the Mars 2020 mission and was intrigued: The Mars 2020 team (the rover hadn\\'t yet been named Perseverance) would need to preserve the architecture of Curiosity but create a new design for the rover, which would collect the first samples from another planet to be returned to Earth on a future mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>Allen joined the Mars 2020 tiger team.</p>\\n\\n<p>On paper, the idea sounded good, but the reality of a whole new suite of instruments turned out to be far more difficult. The work could often feel as terrifying as it was exhilarating. \"A problem can pop up anytime,\" Allen says. \"Someone wakes up at 3 a.m. with a nightmare they didn\\'t consider and boom, we go look at it.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>But Allen never loses sight of the joy behind the work.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Bill is a glass-is-always-half-full kind of guy, even if it\\'s got two drops of water in it,\" says Randy Lindemann, who has worked with Allen for more than 23 years. \"He\\'s got the most positive, upbeat attitude of anybody I\\'ve ever worked with at JPL.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, as Perseverance prepares to land on the Red Planet on Feb. 18, 2021, he\\'s already working his next challenge: helping design the Mars Sample Retrieval Lander.</p>\\n\\n<p>But while Allen thrives on the challenge, that\\'s not necessarily what keeps him going.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"If I could summarize the best thing that\\'s happened to me from being at JPL, it\\'s working with such brilliant minds,\" he says. \"When you consider we do what no one else is doing on the planet, the problems are unique and sometimes the solutions are as well. To be in the mix of those minds to solve some of these problems &ndash; it\\'s been extraordinary.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b><br />\\nDC Agle <br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-9011<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:agle@jpl.nasa.gov\">agle@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Grey Hautaluoma / Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-0668 / 202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:grey.hautaluoma-1@nasa.gov\">grey.hautaluoma-1@nasa.gov</a> / <a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p><i>- Written by Celeste Hoang</i></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8815_C1-bill-allen-Mars-Yard-2020-320.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8815_C1-bill-allen-Mars-Yard-2020-16.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8812, 'title': \"5 Hidden Gems Are Riding Aboard NASA's Perseverance Rover\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover is \"festooned\" with a variety of objects that serve both decorative and functional purposes', 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-12-08T22:43:48.137Z', 'url': '/news/8812/5-hidden-gems-are-riding-aboard-nasas-perseverance-rover/', 'missions': [[180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[165, 'feature', 'Feature Stories']], 'description': \"The symbols, mottos, and small objects added to the agency's newest Mars rover serve a variety of purposes, from functional to decorative.\", 'date': 'December  8, 2020', 'body': '<hr />\\r\\n<p><i>The symbols, mottos, and small objects added to the agency\\'s newest Mars rover serve a variety of purposes, from functional to decorative.</i></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p>More than halfway to the Red Planet, NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover isn\\'t just shuttling sophisticated science instruments and tubes to be filled with Earth-bound rock samples.

Bell is the principal investigator of Perseverance\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8663/nasas-perseverance-rover-will-look-at-mars-through-these-eyes/\">Mastcam-Z</a>, a pair of zoomable cameras that will capture gorgeous color panoramas of the Martian surface.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16131.html\" target=\"_blank\">1909 penny</a> aboard the Curiosity rover nods not just to the hundredth anniversary of the Lincoln penny, but also to how geologists often include a penny for scale when analyzing images of rock features. In fact, the object serves a similar purpose on Curiosity: Scientists use it as a <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/instruments/calibration-targets/\">calibration target</a> &ndash; a kind of default they can use to check the settings of the Mars Hand Lens Imager camera. Because cameras frequently take images of these targets, they\\'re the ideal places to add a motto or decorative symbols for viewing by the public.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As with Curiosity, Perseverance was built at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which leads the mission. Much of the festooning aboard the rover serves a dual purpose.

Launching a rocket off the surface of the Red Planet will require industrial quantities of oxygen, which, along with rocket fuel, makes up propellant: A crew of four would need about 55,000 pounds (25 metric tons) of it to produce thrust from 15,000 pounds (7 metric tons) of rocket fuel.</p>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s a lot of propellant. But instead of shipping all that oxygen, what if the crew could make it out of thin (Martian) air? A first-generation oxygen generator aboard <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/\">NASA\\'s Perseverance rover</a> will test technology for doing exactly that.</p>\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/\">Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment</a>, or MOXIE, is an experimental instrument that stands apart from Perseverance\\'s primary science. One of the rover\\'s main purposes is capturing returnable rock samples that could carry signs of ancient microbial life. While Perseverance has a suite of instruments geared toward helping achieve that goal, MOXIE is focused solely on the engineering required for future human exploration efforts.    </p>\\n\\n<p>Since the dawn of the space age, researchers have talked about in-situ resource utilization, or ISRU. Think of it as living off the land and using what\\'s available in the local environment. That includes things like finding water ice that could be melted for use or sheltering in caves, but also generating oxygen for rocket propellant and, of course, breathing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Breathing is just a side benefit of MOXIE\\'s true goal, said Michael Hecht of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the instrument\\'s principal investigator. Rocket propellant is the heaviest consumable resource that astronauts will need, so being able to produce oxygen at their destination would make the first crewed trip to Mars easier, safer, and cheaper.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"What people typically ask me is whether MOXIE is being developed so astronauts have something to breathe,\" Hecht said. \"But rockets breathe millions of times as much oxygen as people. Fortunately, the rocket has to breathe only for a few minutes during liftoff. But, even so, it needs about 25 tons of oxygen to do that, while the crew needs only about a ton for the entire mission.\"</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25407/components-of-moxie/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'illustration of MOXIE and its components\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25407_2-MOXIE-1200.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Components of MOXIE:</b> An illustration of MOXIE and its components.

It\\'s only 1% as thick as Earth\\'s atmosphere, but it is 95% carbon dioxide, which contains oxygen.</p>\\n\\n<p>MOXIE pulls in that air with a pump, then uses an electrochemical process to separate one oxygen atom from each molecule of carbon dioxide, or CO2, leaving carbon monoxide, or CO, as a byproduct. As the gases flow through the system, they are analyzed to check how much oxygen has been produced, how pure it is, and how efficiently the system is working. All the gases are vented back into the atmosphere after each experiment is run.</p>\\n\\n<p>This electrochemical conversion requires high temperatures &ndash; about 1,470 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) &ndash; in order to work. To manage those high temperatures, MOXIE, which is a little larger than a toaster, features a variety of heat-tolerant materials.

Part of its goal is to gather the basics: temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, and relative humidity.

Dust is a big consideration for any surface mission on Mars. It gets all over everything, including spacecraft and any solar panels they may have. It also drives chemical processes both on the surface and in the atmosphere, and it affects temperature and weather. The Perseverance team wants to learn more about these interactions; doing so will help the team planning operations for <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/\">the Ingenuity Mars helicopter</a> as well.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Understanding Martian dust is very important for this mission,\" said Rodriguez-Manfredi. \"Those fine grains of dust lift off the surface and cover the entire planet. We don\\'t know how Martian winds and changes in temperature are able to cause those global dust storms, but this will be important information for future missions.\" </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While those storms don\\'t blow with the force you see in movies (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1854/the-fact-and-fiction-of-martian-dust-storms/\">Mars\\' atmosphere is too thin for that</a>), they can create a thick blanket of dust. A global dust storm in the summer of 2018 ended the mission of NASA\\'s most seasoned rover, the solar-powered <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8413/nasas-opportunity-rover-mission-on-mars-comes-to-end/\">Opportunity</a>, after almost 15 years of operations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even on placid days, dust on Mars is pervasive &ndash; and invasive. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MEDA will be able to measure the details of the diurnal dust cycle: \"We know that the atmosphere essentially stirs up the dust at noon. Then at nighttime, when the temperatures go down, the atmosphere stabilizes and there\\'s less dust,\" said Manuel de la Torre Juarez, MEDA\\'s deputy principal investigator with NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"We want to know more because as our missions to Mars get bigger, dust considerations could also become more relevant.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Apollo astronauts found lunar dust to be a general nuisance, getting into helmet rings, sticking to spacesuits, and affecting the spacesuits\\' cooling systems. The Apollo missions on the Moon only lasted a few days. Human missions to Mars likely will be much longer, so new data about daily dust cycles will benefit mission planners as well as spacecraft and spacesuit designers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25388/medas-wind-sensor-springs-out/\\' target=\\'_blank\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'wind sensor on Perseverance\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25388_e-PIA24175-10sec.gif\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>MEDA\\'s Wind Sensor Springs Out:</b> One of two wind sensors springs out of the mast on NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover.

On Earth, our atmosphere, along with our planet\\'s magnetic field, shields us from radiation. But there is no global magnetic field at Mars, and its atmosphere is just 1% the density of Earth\\'s. So measuring dust and radiation go hand in hand, especially for spacesuit design.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Radiation is probably the most extreme condition for the astronauts,\" said Rodriguez-Manfredi. \"The suits protecting the astronauts from this radiation will be crucial.\" </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To that end, MEDA\\'s SkyCam will photograph and make videos of the sky and clouds while monitoring sky brightness in a variety of wavelengths to help us better understand the radiation environment on Mars.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ll have our own camera to monitor those clouds and the opacity &ndash; and the amount of dust or other aerosols in the atmosphere that may be changing the intensity of the solar radiation,\" said Rodriguez-Manfredi. \"We\\'ll be able to see how the amount of dust in the atmosphere changes on an hourly basis.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The information will also benefit Perseverance\\'s search for past life. As on Earth, if life ever existed on Mars, it was likely based on organic molecules. Solar radiation can alter traces of that past life in rocks, and data from MEDA will help scientists understand those changes. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Clearing the Air</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MEDA\\'s data will help another instrument on Perseverance: the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/\">Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment</a> (MOXIE). MOXIE will demonstrate a technology that future explorers might use to produce oxygen that can be used for rocket propellant and for breathing. For devices like MOXIE to succeed, mission planners will need more information on what they\\'re up against. \"Are they getting a clean atmosphere?\" said de la Torre Juarez. \"Are they getting a dusty atmosphere? Is this dust going to end up essentially filling up the air filters or not? They may identify times of the day when it is better to run MOXIE, versus times when it is better not to run it.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To take its measurements, MEDA will wake itself up each hour, day and night, whether Perseverance is roving or napping.

The mass spectrometer inhales air and separates the ions that comprise it by their mass, which is how scientists identify them. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stone and his team tracked the abundance of water ions high over Mars for more than two Martian years. In doing so, they determined that the amount of water vapor near the top of the atmosphere at about 93 miles, or 150 kilometers, above the surface is highest during summer in the southern hemisphere. During this time, the planet is closest to the Sun, and thus warmer, and dust storms are more likely to happen. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The warm summer temperatures and strong winds associated with dust storms help water vapor reach the uppermost parts of the atmosphere, where it can easily be broken into its constituent oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen and oxygen then escape to space. Previously, scientists thought that water vapor was trapped close to the Martian surface, like it is on Earth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;Everything that makes it up to the higher part of the atmosphere is destroyed, on Mars or on Earth,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;because this is the part of the atmosphere that is exposed to the full force of the Sun.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\'image_module wide\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25389/how-water-is-lost-on-mars-illustration/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\' illustration shows how water is lost on Mars\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25389_maven_illo_v7-1000.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b><span>How Water is Lost on Mars</span>: </b>This illustration shows how water is lost on Mars normally vs. during regional or global dust storms.

Stone and his colleagues estimated Mars lost as much water in 45 days during this storm as it typically does throughout an entire Martian year, which lasts two Earth years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;We have shown that dust storms interrupt the water cycle on Mars and push water molecules higher in the atmosphere, where chemical reactions can release their hydrogen atoms, which are then lost to space,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/paul.r.mahaffy\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Mahaffy</a>, director of the <a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/solarsystem/\" target=\"_blank\">Solar System Exploration Division</a> at NASA Goddard and principal investigator of NGIMS.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Other scientists have also found that Martian dust storms can lift water vapor far above the surface. But nobody realized until now that the water would make it all the way to the top of the atmosphere. There are abundant ions in this region of the atmosphere that can break apart water molecules 10 times faster than they&rsquo;re destroyed at lower levels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s unique about this discovery is that it provides us with a new pathway that we didn&rsquo;t think existed for water to escape the Martian environment,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/mehdi.benna-1\" target=\"_blank\">Mehdi Benna</a>, a Goddard planetary scientist and co-investigator of MAVEN&rsquo;s NGIMS instrument. &ldquo;It will fundamentally change our estimates of how fast water is escaping today and how fast it escaped in the past.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission.

The robotic scientist has conducted a set of advanced experiments with those samples to extend the search for organic (or carbon-based) molecules in the ancient rocks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since touching down in Gale Crater in 2012, Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp to search for conditions that might once have supported life. This past year, the rover has explored a region of Mount Sharp called Glen Torridon, which likely held lakes and streams billions of years ago. Scientists suspect this is why a high concentration of clay minerals and organic molecules was discovered there. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It will take months for the team to interpret the chemistry and minerals in the samples from the Mary Anning site. In the meantime, the scientists and engineers who have been <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8647/nasas-curiosity-keeps-rolling-as-team-operates-rover-from-home/?site=msl\">commanding the rover from their homes</a> as a safety precaution during the coronavirus pandemic have directed Curiosity to continue its climb of Mount Sharp. The rover\\'s next target of exploration is a layer of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/T1SL0NnXRW0\" target=\"_blank\">sulfate-laden rock</a> that lies higher up the mountain.

The first, NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Mars 2020 Perseverance rover</a>, is more than halfway to Mars following launch in July. Aboard Perseverance is a <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8682/the-extraordinary-sample-gathering-system-of-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/\">sophisticated sampling system</a> with a coring drill and sample tubes that are the cleanest hardware ever sent to space. Once on Mars, Perseverance aims to cache rock and regolith samples in its collection tubes. It then would leave some of them on the Martian surface for an ESA-provided \"fetch\" rover to collect and deliver to a NASA-provided Mars Ascent Vehicle, which then would launch the samples into orbit around Mars. An ESA-provided Earth Return Orbiter would then rendezvous with the samples in orbit around Mars and take them in a highly secure containment capsule for return to Earth in the 2030s.</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Mars Sample Return is something NASA needs to do as a leading member of the global community,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \"We know there are challenges ahead, but that\\'s why we look closely at these architectures. And that\\'s why in the end, we achieve the big accomplishments.\" </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sample return is a top priority of the National Academies\\' Planetary Science Decadal Survey for 2013-2022, and NASA has worked to mature the critical capabilities and overall MSR concept for the past three years. The board acknowledged the longstanding cooperation between NASA and ESA in robotic and human space exploration as an asset for the robust campaign and commended both agencies\\' early and in-depth analysis of MSR implementation approaches to inform future planning and development. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"NASA is committed to mission success and taking on great challenges for the benefit of humanity, and one way we do that is by ensuring we are set up to succeed as early as possible,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science at the agency\\'s headquarters in Washington. \"I thank the members of this board for their many hours of work resulting in a very thorough review. We look forward to continued planning and mission formulation in close partnership with ESA. Ultimately, I believe this sample return will be well worth the effort - bringing us one step closer to our eventual goal of sending humans to Mars.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>NASA initiated the IRB in mid-August to ensure the long-awaited mission is positioned for success. It is the earliest independent review of any NASA Science Mission Directorate large strategic mission. Historically, such reviews have not occurred until much later in the program development. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>David Thompson, retired president and CEO of Orbital ATK, chaired the IRB, which comprised 10 experienced leaders from scientific and engineering fields. The board, which met during 25 sessions from August to October of this year, interviewed experts across NASA and ESA, as well as in industry and academia, and made 44 recommendations to address potential areas of concern regarding the program\\'s scope and management, technical approach, schedule, and funding profile. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"The MSR campaign is a highly ambitious, technically demanding, and multifaceted planetary exploration program with extraordinary scientific potential for world-changing discoveries,\" said Thompson. \"After a thorough review of the agency\\'s planning over the past several years, the IRB unanimously believes that NASA is now ready to carry out the MSR program, the next step for robotic exploration of Mars.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The IRB found that NASA has developed a feasible concept and a broad set of architectural options to inform the planning of the MSR campaign over the next several years and recommends the MSR program proceed. It also highlighted the excellent progress the agency has achieved over the past several years and further emphasized the potential for this program to enable civilization-scale scientific discoveries underscoring that the technology is available now.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"The independent review has given strong support to MSR, which is great news for the campaign,\" says ESA\\'s Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, David Parker. \"It reinforces our shared vision to provide the world\\'s scientists with pristine pieces of the Red Planet to study using laboratory tools and techniques that we could never take to Mars.\" </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The IRB provided its findings and recommendations to NASA for consideration to better position the program for success.

NASA is exploring the technique &ndash; known as additive manufacturing when used by specialized engineers &ndash; to build <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2020/future-rocket-engines-may-include-large-scale-3d-printing.html\" target=\"_blank\">rocket engines</a> as well as potential <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2020/nasa-looks-to-advance-3d-printing-construction-systems-for-the-moon.html\" target=\"_blank\">outposts</a> on the Moon and Mars. Nearer in the future is a different milestone: NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Perseverance</a> rover, which lands on the Red Planet on Feb. 18, 2021, carries 11 metal parts made with 3D printing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Instead of forging, molding, or cutting materials, 3D printing relies on lasers to melt powder in successive layers to give shape to something. Doing so allows engineers to play with unique designs and traits, such as making hardware lighter, stronger, or responsive to heat or cold.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s like working with papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;,\" said Andre Pate, the group lead for additive manufacturing at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"You build each feature layer by layer, and soon you have a detailed part.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a>, Perseverance\\'s predecessor, was the first mission to take 3D printing to the Red Planet. It landed in 2012 with a 3D-printed ceramic part inside the rover\\'s ovenlike Sample Analysis at Mars (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/sam/\">SAM</a>) instrument. NASA has since continued to test 3D printing for use in spacecraft to make sure the reliability of the parts is well understood.</p>\\n\\n<p>As \"secondary structures,\" Perseverance\\'s printed parts wouldn\\'t jeopardize the mission if they didn\\'t work as planned, but as Pate said, \"Flying these parts to Mars is a huge milestone that opens the door a little more for additive manufacturing in the space industry.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>A Shell for PIXL</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Of the 11 printed parts going to Mars, five are in Perseverance\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8759/nasas-new-mars-rover-will-use-x-rays-to-hunt-fossils/\">PIXL</a> instrument.

The resulting craters were relatively small &ndash; just 13 feet (4 meters) in diameter. The smaller the features, the more difficult they are to spot using Mars orbiters.

The accomplishment offers hope for both saving time and increasing the volume of findings.  </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Typically, scientists spend hours each day studying images captured by NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), looking for changing surface phenomena like <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8735/celebrate-mars-reconnaissance-orbiters-views-from-above/\">dust devils, avalanches, and shifting dunes</a>. In the orbiter\\'s 14 years at Mars, scientists have relied on MRO data to find over 1,000 new craters.

Running on a supercomputer cluster at JPL made up of dozens of high-performance computers that can operate in concert with one another, a process that takes a human 40 minutes takes the AI tool an average of just five seconds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One challenge was figuring out how to run up to 750 copies of the classifier across the entire cluster simultaneously, said JPL computer scientist Gary Doran. \"It wouldn\\'t be possible to process over 112,000 images in a reasonable amount of time without distributing the work across many computers,\" Doran said. \"The strategy is to split the problem into smaller pieces that can be solved in parallel.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But despite all that computing power, the classifier still requires a human to check its work.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"AI can\\'t do the kind of skilled analysis a scientist can,\" said JPL computer scientist Kiri Wagstaff. \"But tools like this new algorithm can be their assistants.

Perseverance\\'s LaRA, for example, is a 2-inch-wide (5-centimeter-wide) dome speckled with half-inch holes containing glass cells. In each cell, three mirrored faces are positioned at 90-degree angles from one another so that light entering the holes is directed back out at exactly the same direction it came from.</p>\\n\\n<p>LaRA is much smaller than <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7463\" target=\"_blank\">the retroreflectors on the Moon</a>. The earliest ones, delivered by the Apollo 11 and 14 missions, are about the size of typical computer monitor and embedded with 100 reflectors; the ones delivered by Apollo 15 are even larger and embedded with 300 reflectors. That\\'s because the lasers have to travel as much as 478,000 miles (770,000 kilometers) to the Moon and back. By the return trip, the beams are so faint, they can\\'t be detected by the human eye.</p>\\n\\n<p>The beams that Perseverance\\'s LaRA and InSight\\'s LaRRI were built to reflect would actually have a far shorter journey, despite Mars being some 249 <i>million </i>miles (401 million kilometers) away at its farthest point from Earth. Rather than traveling back and forth from Earth, which would require enormous retroreflectors, the laser beams would just need to travel back and forth from a future Mars orbiter equipped with an appropriate laser.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/internal_resources/details/original/933_Apollo-laser-web.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector on the Moon\\' src=\\'/internal_resources/933\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nA close-up view, taken on Feb. 5, 1971, of the Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector (LR3), which the Apollo 14 astronauts deployed on the Moon during their lunar surface extravehicular activity.

And since Perseverance will be mobile, it could provide multiple points of reference. Meanwhile, the orbiter\\'s position would also be tracked from Earth. This would allow scientists to test Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity, as they have with retroreflectors on the Moon. Each planet\\'s orbit is greatly influenced by the bend in space-time created by the Sun\\'s large mass.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This kind of science is important for understanding how gravity shapes our solar system, the whole universe, and ultimately the roles of dark matter and dark energy,\" Dell\\'Agnello noted.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the case of the InSight lander, which touched down on Nov. 26, 2018, laser-ranging science could also aid the spacecraft\\'s core mission of studying Mars\\' deep interior. InSight relies on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/rise/\">a radio instrument</a> to detect subtle differences in the planet\\'s rotation. In learning from the instrument how the planet wobbles over time, scientists may finally determine whether Mars\\' core is liquid or solid.</p>\\n\\n<p>And if the science team were able to use the lander\\'s retroreflector, they could get even more precise positioning data than InSight\\'s radio provides. LaRRI could also detect how the terrain InSight sits on shifts over time and in what direction, revealing how the Martian crust expands or contracts.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Better Landings on Mars</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Mars landings are hard. To help get Perseverance safely to the surface, the mission will rely on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8456/a-neil-armstrong-for-mars-landing-the-mars-2020-rover/\">Terrain-Relative Navigation</a>, a new technology that compares images taken during descent to an onboard map. If the spacecraft sees itself getting too close to danger (like a cliffside or sand dunes), it can veer away.</p>\\n\\n<p>But in such a mission-critical event, you can never have too many backups. Future missions barreling toward the surface of the Red Planet could use the series of reference points from laser retroreflectors as a check on the performance of their Terrain Relative Navigation systems &ndash; and perhaps even boost their accuracy down to a few centimeters. When the difference between successfully landing near an enticing geological formation or slipping down the steep slope of a crater wall can be measured in mere feet, retroreflectors might be critical.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Laser ranging could open up new kinds of Mars exploration,\" Dell\\'Agnello said.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>More About the Mission</b></p>\\n\\n<p>A key objective for Perseverance\\'s mission on Mars is <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">astrobiology</a>, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life.

After the rover\\'s arm is placed close to an interesting rock, PIXL uses a camera and laser to calculate its distance. Then those legs make tiny movements &ndash; on the order of just 100 microns, or about twice the width of a human hair &ndash; so the device can scan the target, mapping the chemicals found within a postage stamp-size area.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The hexapod figures out on its own how to point and extend its legs even closer to a rock target,\" Allwood said. \"It\\'s kind of like a little robot who has made itself at home on the end of the rover\\'s arm.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><span>Then PIXL measures X-rays in 10-second bursts from a single point on a rock before the instrument tilts 100 microns and takes another measurement.

To minimize the thermal contractions PIXL has to contend with, the instrument will conduct its science after the Sun sets.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"PIXL is a night owl,\" Allwood said. \"The temperature is more stable at night, and that also lets us work at a time when there\\'s less activity on the rover.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><span><div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25268/pixls-hexapod-has-moves/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'PIXLs hexapod\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25268_PIA24094-1041.gif\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n</span><b>PIXL\\'s Hexapod Has Moves:</b><span> A device with six mechanical legs, the hexapod is a critical part of the PIXL instrument aboard NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover.

All of sudden you&rsquo;re in the room, you&rsquo;re in the meeting, you&rsquo;re at the table, you\\'re helping make the decisions, you&rsquo;re leading the test, you&rsquo;re in the thick of it. That\\'s when you realize, you&rsquo;ve made it.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>What are your earliest memories of JPL?</b><br />\\n<span>My mom took me to a JPL open house one year. But when I was little, my earliest memory of JPL was when I used to sneak out of bed to watch \"NOVA\" on PBS. It was Wednesdays at 9 p.m., which was way past my bedtime as a kid. Every now and then, there would be an episode on space exploration. There was actually one on Saturn, and they were talking about engineers at the time who were sending a spacecraft called Cassini over to Saturn. This planted the seed. I really don&rsquo;t think there is another place in the world where you can do the work that we do. It&rsquo;s always been JPL.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>You studied aerospace engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo but said it was a challenging time. What were some of the issues you faced?</b><br />\\n<span>When I was in class, I was either the only brown kid, only woman, or both. There are comments that are made, and you feel that you don&rsquo;t belong and you&rsquo;re not welcomed. I started to struggle with mental health as a result of the classism, sexism, and racism. This happens to a lot of first-generation college students and students from underrepresented and marginalized communities in STEM. But that entire time, I knew I wanted to work for NASA. I wanted to explore the solar system. It had always been my dream, and I knew I had to figure out a way forward. Luckily, at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, there was this great program called the Multicultural Engineering Program, and it was really like a beacon of hope on campus for students of color. I also joined the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and I quickly found a group of students who were like me, similar experiences and also struggling through engineering, but together. I had finally found \"mi familia\" in San Luis Obispo. I was empowered by students who understood the struggle, the obstacles, and the complexities of intersectionality all while being in STEM. All of a sudden, I felt I could get through this. It took a lot of grit and perseverance, but I quickly started to find my confidence in my academics. I ended up graduating with honors, and to me, that was my little comeback story.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25255_IMG_0610.max-800x600.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Graduation day\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25255_IMG_0610.max-800x600.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Graduation Day</b>: Christina Hernandez sported a large Saturn on her cap when she received her master\\'s degree in aerospace engineering from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Credit: Christina Hernandez <a href=\"/resources/25255\">Download image &rsaquo;</a> \\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p><span><b>What were some of your first projects on Lab?</b><br />\\n<span>My thesis work was on orbital debris, so I naturally joined JPL\\'s Natural Space Environment group in the Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate right out of college. My job was to model micrometeoroid environments, perform orbital debris risk assessments for spacecraft, and calculate when our Earth-bound spacecraft reenter at the end of mission, in order to meet the orbital debris mitigation requirements. About a year into working here, I got to work on the tiger team called Comet Siding Spring with Soren Madsen, and that was my introduction to the Mars world. I started on the Perseverance mission over five years, where I was Elizabeth Cordoba\\'s support engineer, who at the time was the instrument engineer for r Radar Imager for Mars\\' Subsurface Experiment, and Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer, which has sensors to measure temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, humidity and dust size and shape. </span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><span>When she became the payload lead systems engineer, she handed off those instruments to me, where I took them from pre-critical design review through Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations.  And since I learned how to swim in those high-octane environments, I ended up with the </span><i>Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry</i><span> instrument, which I got to see through Hardware Requirements Certification Review and eventually will see through to the surface of Mars.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>What have been some of your biggest career challenges?</b><br />\\n<span>I think sometimes, as engineers, when we think of the word challenge, we think of </span><i>technical</i><span> challenge, and there have been plenty of those! But there are also personal challenges. As a Latina, being a woman and being part of the Latinx community, given past experiences, I sometimes felt like I had to try extra hard to prove my worth and make my presence known. I had to take charge of the meeting. I had to be in the problem and part of the solution to make myself feel known and feel like, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m here in the room.&rsquo; After the Perseverance launch, I did a lot of self-reflection on what it means to be a good leader and team member. I realized that as time progressed, I got to the point where I had established already who I was and what I was capable of doing. I had proven it to myself. I didn\\'t need to prove it to others anymore. I recognized that now I needed to challenge myself to know when it was important to take a step back, amplify others, and allow them to grow. The biggest challenge has been becoming a better team member and learning to become a better team leader.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>What are some additional goals that you would like to accomplish?</b><br />\\n<span>Since this interview coincides with Hispanic Heritage Month, I would really love to work toward seeing more Latinx engineers in leadership and in technical roles, especially my Latina sisters. It\\'s one thing to get ourselves up there, but another to also help create and retain a continuous flow of engineers who are on the path toward leadership. One of my goals is to advocate for more mentorship and allyship but not just within our community. Our Black, indigenous and LGBTQ+ communities need our community\\'s help in amplifying their voices and goals. I want to help make JPL even more equitable and inclusive.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>What does it mean to be Latina?</b><br />\\n<span>I grew up not seeing my culture in American history books, and I discovered my culture through my grandmother. You are engrained with this drive of perseverance, hard work, passion, and grit because of the people who come before you. I feel it&rsquo;s in our blood to be hard working, to be passionate about what we do, and whenever I see that in myself, I always link it back to my roots.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>Career-wise, what have been your proudest moments so far?</b><br />\\n<span>The moment that I walked into the clean room to get one of the first instruments that I worked on installed on the rover. I never thought I&rsquo;d be in that room, and it was cool because at the time we had the YouTube live channel and my whole family was able to see me. Going back to launch day, when I saw that countdown and the rocket liftoff, I realized everything that had happened in the past five years. The hardware that we had touched, tested, all the problems, all the successes, all the team happy hours, it was all represented by that rocket launching. I never felt a sense of belonging until that moment.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25257_20191111_104618.max-800x600.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'During Mars Perseverance Rover Testing\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25257_20191111_104618.max-800x600.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nChristina Hernandez during the Mars Perseverance rover testing phase, in an area that includes three instruments she worked on: MEDA, RIMFAX, and PIXL.

I am going to Mars. I&rsquo;d love to go to Neptune, or even go explore an asteroid, or help out with Earth climate science. I would like to explore the universe, and even though I can&rsquo;t necessarily be an explorer today, physically out there in space, I can explore through engineering.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b><br />\\n<span>I love to read and I think that&rsquo;s something that has stayed with me ever since I was little. I&rsquo;m actually in a JPL book club. We love books so much that now we&rsquo;re actually running two book clubs. We have a sci-fi book club and then we have a general book club. I have read 40 books this year, so I have surpassed my goal. If I can get to 60 books by the end of year I would be extremely happy.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>Do you have any advice for students who are looking to follow in a similar career path?</b><br />\\n<span>As engineers, we have to be lifetime learners who are constantly learning and growing every day. Practicing that skill is incredibly important, and you should start as soon as you can. The second thing that I would say is be fearless. Don&rsquo;t be too afraid of failure. It keeps you humble and properly paranoid. I feel JPL has shown me that there are benefits in failing as long as you learn from it. It teaches you to think critically about how to solve a problem, how to come to a solution, and how to identify what caused the problem. That&rsquo;s very much JPL bread and butter there.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span><i>Answers have been edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8756_25254_Christina_hernandez_mainmax-320x240.png', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8756_Christina_Hernandez_main.max-800x600.png', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8749, 'title': \"NASA Readies Perseverance Mars Rover's Earthly Twin \", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': \"Engineers test drive Perseverance Mars rover's twin.\", 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-10-06T22:05:20.293Z', 'url': '/news/8749/nasa-readies-perseverance-mars-rovers-earthly-twin/', 'missions': [[180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[165, 'feature', 'Feature Stories']], 'description': \"Did you know NASA's next Mars rover has a nearly identical sibling on Earth for testing?

While OPTIMISM is an acronym for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars, the name is also a nod to the mantra of the team that spent two years planning and assembling it.</p>\\n\\n<p><span>\"The Mars 2020 Perseverance test bed team\\'s motto is \\'No optimism allowed,\\'\" said Matt Stumbo, the lead for the VSTB rover on the test bed team. \"So we named the test rover OPTIMISM to remind us of the work we have to do to fully test the system. Our job is to find problems, not just hope activities will work. As we work through the issues with OPTIMISM, we gain confidence in Perseverance\\'s capabilities and confidence in our ability to operate on Mars.\" </span></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Almost Identical</b></p>\\n\\n<p>OPTIMISM is nearly identical to Perseverance: It is the same size, has the same mobility system and top driving speed (0.094 mph, or 0.15 kph), and features the same distinctive \"head,\" known as the remote sensing mast. After a second phase of building at the beginning of the new year, it will have the full suite of science instruments, cameras, and computer \"brains\" Perseverance has, plus its <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8682/the-extraordinary-sample-gathering-system-of-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/\">unique system for collecting rock and soil samples</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>But since OPTIMISM lives at JPL, it also features some Earthly differences. For one thing, while Perseverance gets its power from a <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/mars_2020/launch/mission/spacecraft/power/\">multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a> (a kind of nuclear battery that has reliably powered space missions since the 1960s), OPTIMISM features an umbilical cord that can be plugged in for electrical power. That cord also provides an ethernet connection, allowing the mission team to send commands to and receive engineering data back from OPTIMISM without installing the radios Perseverance uses for communication. And whereas Perseverance comes with a heating system to keep it warm in the frigid environment of Mars, OPTIMISM relies on a cooling system for operating in hot Southern California summers.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25251/perseverance-twin-drives-into-the-mars-yard/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Perseverance rover\\'s twin in the Mars Yard at JPL\" src=\\'/internal_resources/931\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Perseverance Twin Drives Into the Mars Yard:</b> The full-scale engineering model of NASA\\'s Perseverance rover has put some dirt on its wheels at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

Perseverance will collect samples from several spots on Mars for return to Earth so scientists can determine if ancient microbial life was ever present on the Red Planet. The independent review board will help NASA review the technical concept developed during preliminary formulation to date for robustness and the ability to satisfy the mission\\'s essential requirements. It will help ensure the agency is adopting lessons learned from its experience with previous large, strategic science missions.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Mars Sample Return is a very high priority for the scientific community, based on the decadal survey and also of strategic importance for our Moon to Mars exploration program,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA\\'s associate administrator for science at the agency\\'s Headquarters in Washington. \"It\\'s a highly complex international mission which requires focus to achieve technical, programmatic and mission success, and we want to have all the expertise available to us at this early stage to maximize mission success.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA has successfully used independent reviews for early-stage strategic missions in the past to put these important science missions on the path to success. As a recent example, the 2017 independent review for the Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST) helped the team make successful scope and cost trades ahead of confirmation.</p>\\n\\n<p>This first leg in the round trip from Earth to Mars and back would take place over the course of multiple missions in partnership with ESA (European Space Agency) as well as industrial partners. The architecture for the mission in its earliest formulation involves Perseverance taking samples and leaving them on the surface of Mars for a \"fetch\" rover, which delivers them to an ascent vehicle that would take them to orbit, while an orbiter launched on another mission would rendezvous with the samples and take them in a highly secure containment capsule for landing back on Earth as early as 2031.</p>\\n\\n<p>The returned samples could potentially provide astrobiological evidence needed to determine if life has ever existed on Mars. The mission itself also advances technologies for human exploration of the Red Planet, including the first launch from the surface of another planet. Strict protocols on forward and backward harmful contamination are being developed for the samples\\' return.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"NASA stands up these independent boards to help the agency learn from past experiences and uncover subtle issues in space systems that may not have yet received sufficient attention,\" said David Thompson, retired president of Orbital ATK, who will chair the new board. \"This review will give us the chance to focus on overall mission success and to consider potential improvements that can be made early in the program to help ensure that outcome.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Experts from various fields, including planetary protection, and NASA\\'s partner in the mission, ESA, will be consulted as the review process moves forward. The board is expected to meet for around eight weeks beginning in late August and to deliver a final report in the weeks after its review is complete.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b><br />\\n<span>Grey Hautaluoma / Joshua Handal</span><br />\\n<span>NASA Headquarters, Washington</span><br />\\n<span>202-358-0668 / 202-358-2307</span><br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:grey.hautaluoma-1@nasa.gov\">grey.hautaluoma-1@nasa.gov</a><span> / </span><a href=\"mailto:joshua.a.handal@nasa.gov\">joshua.a.handal@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8737_24760_PIA23492-320x240.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8737_24760_PIA23492-web.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8736, 'title': \"NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter Recharges Its Batteries in Flight\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter', 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-08-13T15:33:54.372Z', 'url': '/news/8736/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-recharges-its-batteries-in-flight/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program'], [180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[165, 'feature', 'Feature Stories']], 'description': 'Headed to the Red Planet with the Perseverance rover, the pioneering helicopter is powered up for the first time in interplanetary space as part of a systems check.', 'date': 'August 13, 2020', 'body': '<hr />\\n<p><i>Headed to the Red Planet with the Perseverance rover, the pioneering helicopter is powered up for the first time in interplanetary space as part of a systems check. </i></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p>NASA\\'s Ingenuity <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/\">Mars Helicopter</a> received a checkout and recharge of its power system on Friday, Aug. 7, one week into its near seven-month journey to Mars with the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Perseverance</a> rover.

The brightenings occur where vertical winds carry gases down to regions of higher density, speeding up the chemical reactions that create nitric oxide and power the ultraviolet glow. Schneider is instrument lead for the MAVEN Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) instrument that made these observations, and lead author of a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JA027318\" target=\"_blank\">paper on this research</a> appearing August 6 in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Physics.

Too bad: the bright patches would intensify overhead every night after sunset, and drift across the sky at 300 kilometers per hour (about 180 miles per hour).&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>The pulsations reveal the importance of planet-encircling waves in the Mars atmosphere. The number of waves and their speed indicates that Mars&rsquo; middle atmosphere is influenced by the daily pattern of solar heating and disturbances from the topography of Mars&rsquo; huge volcanic mountains. These pulsating spots are the clearest evidence that the middle atmosphere waves match those known to dominate the layers above and below.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;MAVEN&rsquo;s main discoveries of atmosphere loss and climate change show the importance of these vast circulation patterns that transport atmospheric gases around the globe and from the surface to the edge of space.&rdquo; said Sonal Jain, also of LASP.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, the team plans to look at nightglow &ldquo;sideways&rdquo;, instead of down from above, using data taken by IUVS looking just above the edge of the planet.

Credit: NASA. <a href=\"/resources/25151/spacesuit-designer-amy-ross/\">Download image &rsaquo;</a> \\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p><b>Why were these particular materials on SHERLOC\\'s calibration target selected?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Ross:</b> The materials we\\'re poking at the most are meant to be on the outer layer of a suit, since these will be exposed to the most radiation. There\\'s ortho-fabric, something we have a lot of experience using on the outside of spacesuits. That\\'s three materials in one: It includes Nomex, a flame-resistant material found in firefighter outfits; Gore-Tex, which is waterproof but breathable; and Kevlar, which has been used in bulletproof vests.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are also testing a sample of Vectran on its own, which we currently use for the palms of spacesuit gloves. It\\'s cut-resistant, which is useful on the International Space Station: Micrometeoroids strike handrails outside the station, creating pits with sharp edges that can cut gloves.</p>\\n\\n<p>We included a sample of Teflon, which we\\'ve used in spacesuits for a long time as part of astronaut glove gauntlets and the backs of gloves. Just like a nonstick pan, it\\'s slippery, and it\\'s harder to catch and tear a fabric if it\\'s slick. We also included a sample of Teflon with a dust-resistant coating.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, there\\'s a piece of polycarbonate, which we use for helmet bubbles and visors because it helps reduce ultraviolet light. A nice thing about it is it doesn\\'t shatter. If impacted, it bends rather than breaks and still has good optical properties.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>How will SHERLOC check the samples?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Ross:</b> On Mars, radiation will break down the chemical composition of the materials, weakening their tensile strength. We want to figure out how long these materials will last. Do we need to develop new materials, or will these hang in there?</p>\\n\\n<p>SHERLOC can get the spectra, or composition, of rocks the mission\\'s scientists want to study. It can do the same thing for these spacesuit materials. We\\'ve already tested them on Earth, bathing samples in radiation and then analyzing their spectra. The results of those tests, conducted in ultraviolet vacuum chambers at NASA\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center, will be compared to what we see on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Will Martian dust be a challenge?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure, it\\'s an engineering challenge, but there\\'s no reason we can\\'t design things to operate in dust. We\\'re already developing things like seals that keep dust out of our bearings. Spacesuits have bearings at the shoulders, wrists, hip, upper thighs, and ankles. They all give an astronaut mobility for walking, kneeling, and other movements you\\'d need to get up close to rocks or maintain a habitat.</p>\\n\\n<p>Remember, our suits inflate to over 4 pounds per square inch of pressure. That\\'s not a crazy amount of pressure, but it\\'s pretty stiff. When you put a human inside a balloon and ask them to move, they\\'ll have trouble. It\\'s as tight as the head of a drum. So we need to seal off the bearings so dust doesn\\'t gunk them up.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are looking for other ways to protect the suit from Martian dust over a long-duration mission. We know that a coated or film material will be better than a woven material that has space between the woven yarns. The two Teflon samples let us look at that as well as the performance of the dust-resistant coating.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>How much would spacesuit design differ between the space station, the Moon, and Mars?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Ross:</b> Spacesuit design depends on where you\\'re going and what you\\'re doing. The ISS suit is designed specifically for microgravity. If you go on a spacewalk, you\\'re not really walking; you use your hands everywhere. Your lower torso is just used as a stable platform for your upper body. The suit is also exposed to two environmental sources of degradation: solar radiation and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/atomic_oxygen.html\">atomic oxygen</a>. Atomic oxygen is different from the oxygen we breathe. It\\'s very reactive and can degrade spacesuit materials.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Moon doesn\\'t have the atomic oxygen problem but is worse than Mars in terms of radiation. You\\'re pretty close to the Sun and have no atmosphere to scatter the ultraviolet radiation like you do on Mars. The Moon is a big testbed for <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/\" target=\"_blank\">the Artemis program</a>. The environments of the Moon and Mars aren\\'t exactly the same, but the durability challenges &ndash; materials exposed over long periods of time at low pressures in a dusty environment &ndash; are similar.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Mars, you\\'re farther from the Sun, and you have at least a little atmosphere to scatter the UV.

This new three-minute video from NASA lays out the science behind this ambitious <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">astrobiology</a> mission, which lands on Feb. 18, 2021, in Jezero Crater. Home to a lake billions of years ago, it isn\\'t your typical Mars crater. \"This is a wonderful place to live for microorganisms,\" says Perseverance Project Scientist Ken Farley of Caltech, speaking of the time when the lake was still there. \"And it is also a wonderful place for those microorganisms to be preserved so that we can find them now so many billions of years later.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Watch as Farley of Caltech and Deputy Project Scientist Katie Stack-Morgan of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory talk about the tricky task of gathering those rock and sediment samples, which will be the first collected from another planet for eventual return to Earth, where they can undergo the sort of scientific investigation that demands instruments too large and complex to send to Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>More About the Mission</b></p>\\n\\n<p>A division of Caltech in Pasadena, JPL manages the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission for the agency\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

The incredible science Perseverance will enable and the bold human missions it will help make possible are going to be inspirations for us all.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'re pleased to be passing another milestone with the completion of the Flight Readiness Review,\" said Matt Wallace, deputy project manager for the mission at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California. \"But we&rsquo;ll keep our heads down through the final prelaunch activities and the opening of the launch window next week, until we\\'re certain this spacecraft is safely on its way. Mars is a tough customer, and we don&rsquo;t take anything for granted.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>With all the connections between the spacecraft and Atlas V launch vehicle complete, the majority of business remaining for Mars 2020\\'s Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO) team involves checking out every one of the multitude of systems and subsystems onboard the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/overview/\">rover, aeroshell, cruise stage, and descent stage.</a></p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;NASA can&rsquo;t wait to take the next steps on the surface of Mars with Perseverance,&rdquo; said Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. &ldquo;The science and technology of this mission are going to help us address major questions about the geologic and astrobiologic history of Mars that we&rsquo;ve been working on for decades, and we&rsquo;re excited to take the whole world with us on this journey.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>\"At this point, the spacecraft has been powered on and will remain so around the clock,\" said Dave Gruel, ATLO manager for Mars 2020. \"The launch operations team will continue to monitor the health of the spacecraft to ensure it&rsquo;s \\'Go\\' for launch &ndash; nothing glamorous, but an important part of the job.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The spacecraft and launch teams have one more major review to complete. Scheduled Monday, July 27, the Launch Readiness Review is the last significant checkup before the mission receives final approval to proceed with launch.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"At present, everything is green across the board,\" said Wallace. \"Everyone involved with this endeavor, from the spacecraft team to the launch vehicle team to those working the range, are looking forward to seeing Perseverance begin its long-awaited flight to Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Around 1 p.m. EDT on July 27, or approximately one hour after the Launch Readiness Review ends, the agency will hold a preflight news conference that will air live on NASA Television and the agency&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/live\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Other prelaunch briefings also will take place July 27, and Tuesday, July 28.

Previous groundbreaking technology demonstrations include the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-exploration/missions/pathfinder/\">Mars Pathfinder</a> rover Sojourner and the tiny <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Cube One</a> (MarCO) CubeSats that flew by Mars in 2018.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ingenuity features four specially made carbon-fiber blades, arranged into two rotors that spin in opposite directions at around 2,400 rpm &ndash; many times faster than a passenger helicopter on Earth.

For one thing, Mars\\' thin atmosphere makes it difficult to achieve enough lift. Because the Mars atmosphere is 99% less dense than Earth\\'s, Ingenuity has to be light, with rotor blades that are much larger and spin much faster than what would be required for a helicopter of Ingenuity\\'s mass on Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>It can also be bone-chillingly cold at <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8549/nasas-mars-2020-will-hunt-for-microscopic-fossils/\">Jezero Crater</a>, where Perseverance will land with Ingenuity attached to its belly in February 2021. Nights there dip down to minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius). While Ingenuity\\'s team on Earth has tested the helicopter at Martian temperatures and believes it should work on Mars as intended, the cold will push the design limits of many of Ingenuity\\'s parts.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition, flight controllers at JPL won\\'t be able to control the helicopter with a joystick. Communication delays are an inherent part of working with spacecraft across interplanetary distances. Commands will need to be sent well in advance, with engineering data coming back from the spacecraft long after each flight takes place. In the meantime, Ingenuity will have a lot of autonomy to make its own decisions about how to fly to a waypoint and keep itself warm.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>3. Ingenuity is a fitting name for a robot that is the result of extreme creativity. </b></p>\\n\\n<p>High school student Vaneeza Rupani of Northport, Alabama, originally submitted the name Ingenuity for the Mars 2020 rover, before it was <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8622/virginia-middle-school-student-earns-honor-of-naming-nasas-next-mars-rover/\">named Perseverance</a>, but NASA officials <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8659/alabama-high-school-student-names-nasas-mars-helicopter/\">recognized the submission</a> as a terrific name for the helicopter, given how much creative thinking the team employed to get the mission off the ground. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"The ingenuity and brilliance of people working hard to overcome the challenges of interplanetary travel are what allow us all to experience the wonders of space exploration,\" Rupani wrote. \"Ingenuity is what allows people to accomplish amazing things.\"</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25118_PIA23962-16.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Artist\\'s concept of the Perseverance and Ingenuity rover\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25118_PIA23962-16.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Portrait of Perseverance and Ingenuity (Artist\\'s Concept)</b>: In February 2021, NASA\\'s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and NASA\\'s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter (shown in an artist\\'s concept) will be the agency\\'s two newest explorers on Mars.

They tested progressively more advanced models in special space simulators at JPL. In January 2019, the actual helicopter that is riding with Perseverance to the Red Planet passed its final flight evaluation.

These highlights will get you up to speed on the ambitious mission.</i></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p>In less than a month, NASA expects to launch the Mars 2020 Perseverance mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Loaded with scientific instruments, advanced computational capabilities for landing, and other new systems, the Perseverance rover is the largest, heaviest, most sophisticated vehicle NASA has ever sent to the Red Planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Perseverance sets a new bar for our ambitions at Mars,\" said Lori Glaze, planetary science director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"We will get closer than ever before to answering some of science\\'s longest-standing questions about the Red Planet, including whether life ever arose there.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>What drives Perseverance\\'s mission and what will it do at the Red Planet? Here are seven things to know: </p>\\n\\n<p><b>1. The Perseverance rover draws on the NASA &ndash; and scientific &ndash; spirit of overcoming challenges. </b></p>\\n\\n<p>The rover has a tough mission. Not only does it have to land on a treacherous planet, it has to work on its science goals: searching for signs of ancient microbial life, characterizing the planet\\'s geology and climate, collecting carefully selected rock and sediment samples for future return to Earth, and paving the way for human exploration beyond the Moon.</p>\\n\\n<p>These activities epitomize why NASA chose the name <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/\">Perseverance</a> from among the 28,000 essays submitted during the \"Name the Rover\" contest. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the months leading up to the launch in particular have required <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8654/how-nasas-perseverance-mars-team-adjusted-to-work-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/\">creative problem solving</a>, teamwork, and determination.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Building this incredibly sophisticated rover has been the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of as an engineer,\" said Ray Baker, the mission\\'s flight system manager at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"While coronavirus added significant challenges and logistics, the team has shown great determination and diligence to build a rover we can be proud to send to Mars. We can\\'t wait to see the many years of dedication pay off at the launch pad.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>2. Perseverance builds on the lessons of other Mars rovers.</b></p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s modest first rover &ndash; Sojourner &ndash; demonstrated in 1997 that a robot could rove on the Red Planet. Spirit and Opportunity, which landed in 2004, found evidence that the planet once hosted running water before becoming a frozen desert. Curiosity, which has been exploring Mars since 2012, discovered that its landing site, Gale Crater, was home to of a lake billions of years ago, with an environment <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1438/nasa-rover-finds-conditions-once-suited-for-ancient-life-on-mars/\">that could have supported microbial life</a>.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Perseverance aims to take the next step, seeking, as a primary goal, to answer one of the key questions of <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about/\" target=\"_blank\">astrobiology</a>: Are there any signs that life once existed on Mars?</p>\\n\\n<p><b>3. The rover will be landing in a place with high potential for finding signs of past microbial life.</b></p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8549/nasas-mars-2020-will-hunt-for-microscopic-fossils/\">Jezero Crater</a> is 28 miles (45 kilometers) wide and sits on the western edge of Isidis Planitia, a giant basin just north of the Martian equator dug out long ago when a space rock hit the surface. Sometime between 3 billion and 4 billion years ago at Jezero, a river flowed into a body of water the size of Lake Tahoe.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The science team has had many discussions internally and externally about where the next Mars rover should go,\" said Ken Farley, the mission\\'s project scientist, based at Caltech in Pasadena. \"We ultimately chose Jezero Crater because it is such a promising location for finding organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>3. Perseverance will also be collecting important data about Mars\\' geology and climate.</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Mars orbiters have been collecting images and other data from Jezero Crater from about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above, but finding signs of ancient life on the surface will require much closer inspection. It demands a rover like Perseverance, which can look for signs that may be related to life and can analyze the context in which they were found to see if they were biological in origin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Understanding Mars\\' past climate conditions and reading the geological history embedded in its rocks will also give us a sense of why Earth and Mars &ndash; which formed from the same primordial stuff &ndash; ended up so different.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>5. Perseverance is the first leg of a round trip to Mars.</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Verifying ancient microscopic life on Mars carries an enormous burden of proof. Perseverance is the first rover to bring a sample-gathering system to Mars that will package promising examples of rocks and sediments for return to Earth by a future mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PVjj0PEPMA\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Sample Return campaign</a> is being planned by NASA and the European Space Agency because here on Earth we can investigate the samples with instruments too large and complex to send to Mars. Terrestrial laboratories would be used to establish whether any potential signs of life detected by the rover are definitive evidence of past life.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>6. Perseverance carries instruments and technology that will pave the way for human missions to the Moon and Mars.</b>  </p>\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing/#Terrain-Relative-Navigation\">Terrain-Relative Navigation</a> system, which autonomously helps the rover avoid hazards during landing, and the Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2 (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing/#MEDLI2\">MEDLI2</a>) sensor suite, which gathers crucial data during the journey through the Martian atmosphere, will help <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8449/nasas-mars-2020-will-blaze-a-trail-for-humans/\">future human missions</a> land more safely and with larger payloads on other worlds.</p>\\n\\n<p>Perseverance also has features that will help astronauts once they\\'re on the surface of another world: improved self-driving smarts for more efficient travel and the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/meda/\">MEDA</a>) instrument suite, which will provide key information about weather, climate, and dust. Meanwhile, the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/\">MOXIE</a>) technology demonstration aims to produce oxygen from Mars\\' carbon dioxide atmosphere, demonstrating a way future explorers might produce oxygen for rocket propellant as well as for breathing.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>7.

The mission is providing the first look at <a href=\"/news/8613/a-year-of-surprising-science-from-nasas-insight-mars-mission/?site=insight\">the Red Planet\\'s deep interior</a> to reveal details about the formation of Mars and, ultimately, all rocky planets, including Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Akin to a 16-inch-long (40-centimeter-long) pile driver, the self-hammering mole has experienced difficulty getting into the Martian soil since February 2019. It\\'s mostly buried now, thanks to recent efforts to <a href=\"/news/8612/mars-insight-lander-to-push-on-top-of-the-mole/?site=insight\">push down on the mole</a> with the scoop on the end of the robotic arm. But whether it will be able to dig deep enough &ndash; at least 10 feet (3 meters) &ndash; to get an accurate temperature reading of the planet remains to be seen. Images taken by InSight during a Saturday, June 20, hammering session show bits of soil jostling within the scoop &ndash; possible evidence that the mole had begun bouncing in place, knocking the bottom of the scoop.</p>\\n\\n<p>While the campaign to save the mole continues, the arm will be used to help carry out other science and engineering work. Here\\'s what you can expect in the months ahead from the mission, which is led by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>What\\'s next for the mole?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The mole is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or <a href=\"/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>, that the German Aerospace Center (DLR) provided NASA. While the scoop on the end of InSight\\'s arm has blocked the mole from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAInSight/status/1188523020718985216\" target=\"_blank\">backing out of its pit again</a>, it also blocks the arm\\'s camera from seeing the mole and the pit that has formed around it. Over the next few weeks, the team will move the arm out of the way to better assess how the soil and mole are interacting.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mole needs friction from soil in order to burrow. Ironically, loose soil provides that friction as it collapses around the mole. But the soil beneath InSight has proven to be cement-like duricrust, with dirt granules that stick together. As a result, recoil from the mole\\'s self-hammering action causes it to bounce in place. So the team\\'s next moves may be to provide that friction by scraping or chopping nearby soil to move it into the pit it\\'s in.</p>\\n\\n<p>More thoughts about the mole\\'s recent progress can be found on a <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/blogs/en/all-blog-posts/The-InSight-mission-logbook.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> written by HP<sup>3</sup>\\'s principal investigator, Tilman Spohn of DLR.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>What\\'s next for InSight\\'s arm?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight landed on Mars on Nov. 26, 2018. Its robotic arm subsequently set HP<sup>3</sup>, a seismometer and the seismometer\\'s Wind and Thermal Shield on to the planet\\'s surface. While the arm has been key to helping the mole, scientists and engineers are eager to use the arm\\'s camera to pan over InSight\\'s solar panels, something they haven\\'t done since July 17, 2019.</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s the dusty season on Mars, and the panels are likely coated with a fine layer of reddish-brown particles. Estimating how much dust is on the solar panels will let engineers better understand InSight\\'s daily power supply.</p>\\n\\n<p>Scientists also want to resume using the arm to spot meteors streaking across the night sky, as they did earlier in the mission. Doing so could help them predict how often meteors strike this part of the planet. They could also cross-check to see whether data from InSight\\'s seismometer reveals a meteor impact on Mars shortly afterward.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>What\\'s next for the seismometer?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight\\'s seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href=\"/insight/mission/instruments/seis\">SEIS</a>), detected its first marsquake nearly three months after starting its measurements in January 2019. By the fall of 2019, it was detecting a potential quake or two per day. While SEIS has detected more than 480 seismic signals overall, the rate has dropped to less than one per week.</p>\\n\\n<p>This rate change is tied to seasonal variations of atmospheric turbulence, which creates noise that covers up the tiny quake signals. Despite the protective Wind and Thermal Shield, SEIS is sensitive enough that shaking from the wind hitting the shield can make quakes harder to isolate.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>More About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

Rover planners allow for this when they lack terrain imagery. (Planners hope for more autonomy in the future; in fact, <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8689/nasas-mars-rover-drivers-need-your-help/?site=msl\">you can help train an algorithm</a> that identifies Martian drive paths.)</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Curiosity can\\'t drive entirely without humans in the loop,\" said Matt Gildner, lead rover driver at JPL. \"But it does have the ability to make simple decisions along the way to avoid large rocks or risky terrain.

It likely represents a major transition in the climate of Gale Crater. At some point, the lakes that filled the 96-mile-wide (154-kilometer-wide) crater disappeared, leaving behind sediments that eroded into the mountain we see today. The pediment formed later (though whether from wind or water erosion remains unknown); then windblown sand blanketed its surface, building into the sandstone cap.</p>\\n\\n<p>The northern end of the pediment spans the clay region, and though the slope is steep, the rover\\'s team decided to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8631/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-takes-a-new-selfie-before-record-climb/?site=msl\">ascend Greenheugh</a> back in March for a preview of terrain they\\'ll see later in the mission.

At some point after the pediment formed, water seems to have returned, altering the rock as it flowed through it.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>These bumps may look familiar to Mars rover fans: One of Curiosity\\'s predecessors, the Opportunity rover, found similar geologic textures dubbed \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6944/martian-blueberries/\">blueberries</a>\" back in 2004. Nodules have become a familiar sight throughout Mount Sharp, though these newly discovered ones are different in composition from what Opportunity found.

They eventually landed on Perseverance\\'s belly, which on a relatively flat stretch of Red Planet surface should offer about 26 inches (67 centimeters) of ground clearance. While that may seem like a lot of room (an Earthly SUV provides about a third of that), the delivery system reduces that distance by about 2 inches (6 centimeters). Ingenuity is about 19 inches (49 centimeters) tall. This is where the 5-inch journey comes in.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"That is not a lot of room to play with,\" said Salvo, \"but we found if you attach the helicopter horizontally, there is enough to get the job done.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>How the Job Is Done</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Ingenuity will be deployed about two months after Perseverance lands on Feb. 18, 2021.

Then it will drive into the center of the chosen airfield. About six days later, after the helicopter and rover teams are satisfied everything is go, they\\'ll command Mars Helicopter Delivery System to do its thing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The deployment process begins with the release of a locking mechanism that keeps the helicopter in place. Then a cable-cutting pyrotechnic device fires, allowing a spring-loaded arm that holds the helicopter to begin rotating Ingenuity out of its horizontal position. Along the way, a small electric motor will pull the arm until it latches, bringing the helicopter body completely vertical with two of its spring-loaded landing legs deployed. Another pyrotechnic fires, releasing the other legs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"And all the while, the deployment system has to maintain electrical and data cable connections between rover and helicopter until it\\'s ready to drop,\" said David Buecher, deployment system manager at Lockheed Martin Space in Denver, which built the system. \"While I have worked on my fair share of space-based deployment systems, this one was on another level.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><div class=\\'image_module wide\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24933/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\"The flight model of NASA\\'s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24933_2-PIA23882-2nd-800w.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>NASA\\'s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter:</b> The flight model of NASA\\'s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.

But before any of that happens, a test vehicle has to prove it\\'s possible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And before the test vehicle can do any of that, it has to land safely on the surface of Mars.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Ingenuity needs Perseverance,\" said Aung. \"The Mars Helicopter Delivery System is an ingenious gizmo and just one of the examples of how the Mars 2020 mission has worked above and beyond the call to accommodate our test project. Along with it and the helicopter, they had to incorporate an electronic base station and antenna dedicated entirely to helicopter operations into the rover. Our teams had to work closely together to make this complex system work. When Ingenuity flies, it will be an achievement we can all share.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>About the Mars 2020 Mission</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A division of Caltech in Pasadena, JPL built and manages the helicopter for NASA.

SPOC is already in use, but the system could use further training.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Typically, hundreds of thousands of examples are needed to train a deep learning algorithm,\" said Hiro Ono, an AI researcher at JPL. \"Algorithms for self-driving cars, for example, are trained with numerous images of roads, signs, traffic lights, pedestrians and other vehicles. Other public datasets for deep learning contain people, animals and buildings &mdash; but no Martian landscapes.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Once fully up to speed, SPOC will be able to automatically distinguish between cohesive soil, high rocks, flat bedrock and dangerous sand dunes, sending images to Earth that will make it easier to plan Curiosity\\'s next moves.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"In the future, we hope this algorithm can become accurate enough to do other useful tasks, like predicting how likely a rover\\'s wheels are to slip on different surfaces,\" Ono said.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Job of Rover Planners</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL engineers called rover planners may benefit the most from a better-trained SPOC. They are responsible for Curiosity\\'s every move, whether it\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8631/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-takes-a-new-selfie-before-record-climb/?site=msl\">taking a selfie</a>, trickling pulverized samples <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XXaa4_02Edw\" target=\"_blank\">into the rover\\'s body</a> to be analyzed or driving from one spot to the next.</p>\\n\\n<p>It can take four to five hours to work out a drive (which is <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8647/nasas-curiosity-keeps-rolling-as-team-operates-rover-from-home/?site=msl\">now done virtually</a>), requiring multiple people to write and review hundreds of lines of code. The task involves extensive collaboration with scientists as well: Geologists assess the terrain to predict whether Curiosity\\'s wheels could slip, be damaged by sharp rocks or get stuck in sand, which trapped both the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20110525a.html\">Spirit</a> and <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20050606a.html\">Opportunity</a> rovers.</p>\\n\\n<p>Planners also consider which way the rover will be pointed at the end of a drive, since its <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/rover/communication/#high-gain\">high-gain antenna</a> needs a clear line of sight to Earth to receive commands. And they try to anticipate shadows falling across the terrain during a drive, which can interfere with how Curiosity determines distance. (The rover uses a technique called visual odometry, comparing camera images to nearby landmarks.)</p>\\n\\n<p><b>How AI Could Help</b></p>\\n\\n<p>SPOC won\\'t replace the complicated, time-intensive work of rover planners. But it can free them to focus on other aspects of their job, like discussing with scientists which rocks to study next.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s our job to figure out how to safely get the mission\\'s science,\" said Stephanie Oij, one of the JPL rover planners involved in AI4Mars. \"Automatically generating terrain labels would save us time and help us be more productive.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The benefits of a smarter algorithm would extend to planners on NASA\\'s next Mars mission, the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Perseverance rover</a>, which launches this summer. But first, an archive of labeled images is needed. More than 8,000 Curiosity images have been uploaded to the AI4Mars site so far, providing plenty of fodder for the algorithm. Ono hopes to add images from Spirit and Opportunity in the future. In the meantime, JPL volunteers are translating the site so that participants who speak Spanish, Hindi, Japanese and several other languages can contribute as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more, visit:</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b><br />\\nAndrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Grey Hautaluoma / Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-0668 / 202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:grey.hautaluoma-1@nasa.gov\">grey.hautaluoma-1@nasa.gov</a> / <a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8689_PIA23897-320x240.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8689_PIA23897-16.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8687, 'title': \"Three New Views of Mars' Moon Phobos\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'Six views of the Martian moon Phobos', 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-06-08T18:15:00.688Z', 'url': '/news/8687/three-new-views-of-mars-moon-phobos/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program'], [179, 'odyssey', 'Mars Odyssey']], 'news_type': [[165, 'feature', 'Feature Stories']], 'description': \"Taken with the infrared camera aboard NASA's Odyssey orbiter, they reveal temperature variations on the small moon as it drifts into and out of Mars’ shadow.\", 'date': 'June  8, 2020', 'body': '<hr />\\n<p><i>Taken with the infrared camera on NASA\\'s Odyssey orbiter, the images reveal temperature variations aboard the small moon as it drifts into and out of Mars\\' shadow.</i></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p>Three new views of the Martian moon Phobos have been captured by NASA\\'s Odyssey orbiter.

Located on the front of the Perseverance rover, the Sample Caching System itself is composed of three robots, the most visible being the rover\\'s 7-foot-long (2-meter-long) robotic arm. Bolted to the front of the rover\\'s chassis, the five-jointed arm carries a large turret that includes a rotary percussive drill to collect core samples of Mars rock and regolith (broken rock and dust).</p>\\n\\n<p>The second robot looks like a small flying saucer built into the front of the rover. Called the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8503/robotic-toolkit-added-to-nasas-mars-2020-rover/\">bit carousel</a>, this appliance is the ultimate middleman for all Mars sample transactions: It will provide drill bits and empty sample tubes to the drill and will later move the sample-filled tubes into the rover chassis for assessment and processing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The third robot in the Sample Caching System is the 1.6-foot-long (0.5 meter-long) sample handling arm (known by the team as the \"<i>T. rex</i> arm\"). Located in the belly of the rover, it picks up where the bit carousel leaves off, moving sample tubes between storage and documentation stations as well as the bit carousel.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Clocklike Precision</b></p>\\n\\n<p>All of these robots need to run with clocklike precision. But where the typical Swiss chronometer has fewer than 400 parts, the Sample Caching System has more than 3,000.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It sounds like a lot, but you begin to realize the need for complexity when you consider the Sample Caching System is tasked with autonomously drilling into Mars rock, pulling out intact core samples and then sealing them hermetically in hyper-sterile vessels that are essentially free of any Earth-originating organic material that could get in the way of future analysis,\" said Steltzner. \"In terms of technology, it is the most complicated, most sophisticated mechanism that we have ever built, tested and readied for spaceflight.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The mission\\'s goal is to collect a dozen or more samples. So how does this three-robot, steamer-trunk-sized labyrinthine collection of motors, planetary gearboxes, encoders and other devices all meticulously work together to take them?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Essentially, after our rotary percussive drill takes a core sample, it will turn around and dock with one of the four docking cones of the bit carousel,\" said Steltzner. \"Then the bit carousel rotates that Mars-filled drill bit and a sample tube down inside the rover to a location where our sample handling arm can grab it. That arm pulls the filled sample tube out of the drill bit and takes it to be imaged by a camera inside the Sample Caching System.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After the sample tube is imaged, the small robotic arm moves it to the volume assessment station, where a ramrod pushes down into the sample to gauge its size. \"Then we go back and take another image,\" said Steltzner. \"After that, we pick up a seal &mdash; a little plug &mdash; for the top of the sample tube and go back to take yet another image.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, the Sample Caching System places the tube in the sealing station, where a mechanism hermetically seals the tube with the cap. \"Then we take the tube out,\" added Steltzner, \"and we return it to storage from where it first began.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Getting the system designed and manufactured, then integrated into Perseverance has been a seven-year endeavor. And the work isn\\'t done. As with everything else on the rover, there are two versions of the Sample Caching System: an engineering test model that will stay here on Earth and the flight model that will travel to Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The engineering model is identical in every way possible to the flight model, and it\\'s our job to try to break it,\" said Kelly Palm, the Sample Caching System integration engineer and Mars 2020 test lead at JPL. \"We do that because we would rather see things wear out or break on Earth than on Mars. So we put the engineering test model through its paces to inform our use of its flight twin on Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>To that end, the team uses different rocks to simulate types of terrain. They drill them from various angles to anticipate any imaginable situation the rover could be in where the science team might want to gather a sample.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Every once in a while, I have to take a minute and contemplate what we are doing,\" said Palm. \"Just a few years ago I was in college. Now I am working on the system that will be responsible for collecting the first samples from another planet for return to Earth. That is pretty awesome.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About the Mission</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Perseverance is a robotic scientist weighing about 2,260 pounds (1,025 kilograms). The rover\\'s astrobiology mission will search for signs of past microbial life.

Scientists can identify different molecules based on the distinctive spectral \"fingerprint\" visible in their emitted light. An ultraviolet laser that is part of SHERLOC will allow the team to classify organics and minerals present in a rock and understand the environment in which the rock formed. Salty water, for example, can result in the formation of different minerals than fresh water. The team will also be looking for astrobiology clues in the form of organic molecules, which among other things, serve as potential biosignatures, demonstrating the presence life in Mars\\' ancient past.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Life is clumpy,\" Beegle said. \"If we see organics clumping together on one part of a rock, it might be a sign that microbes thrived there in the past.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Nonbiological processes can also form organics, so detecting the compounds isn\\'t a sure sign that life formed on Mars.

Since they know in advance what the readings should be when an instrument is working correctly, scientists can make adjustments accordingly.</p>\\n\\n<p>About the size of a smartphone, SHERLOC\\'s calibration target includes 10 objects, including a sample of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8308/a-piece-of-mars-is-going-home/\">a Martian meteorite</a> that traveled to Earth and was found in the Oman desert in 1999. Studying how this meteorite fragment changes over the course of the mission will help scientists understand the chemical interactions between the planet\\'s surface and its atmosphere. SuperCam, another instrument aboard Perseverance, has a piece of Martian meteorite on its calibration target as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>While scientists are returning fragments of Mars back to the surface of the Red Planet to further their studies, they\\'re counting on Perserverance to gather dozens of rock and soil samples for future return to Earth. The samples the rover collects will be exhaustively studied, with data taken from the landscape in which they formed, and they\\'ll include different rock types than the meteorites.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next to the Martian meteorite are <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8448/johnson-built-device-to-help-mars-2020-rover-search-for-signs-of-life/\">five samples of spacesuit fabric and helmet material</a> developed by NASA\\'s Johnson Space Center. SHERLOC will take readings of these materials as they change in the Martian landscape over time, giving spacesuit designers a better idea of how they degrade. When the first astronauts step on to Mars, they might have SHERLOC to thank for the suits that keep them safe.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About the Mission</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Perseverance is a robotic scientist weighing about 2,260 pounds (1,025 kilograms). The rover\\'s astrobiology mission will search for signs of past microbial life. It will characterize the planet\\'s climate and geology, collect samples for future return to Earth, and pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet. No matter what day Perseverance launches during its July 17-Aug. 11 launch period, it will land at Mars\\' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is part of a larger program that includes missions to the Moon as a way to prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.

Earth\\'s aurora are strongly linked to currents, generated by the interaction of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field with the solar wind, that flow along vertical magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, concentrating in the polar regions. Studying the flow of electricity thousands of miles above our heads, though, only tells part of the story about the situation on Mars. The difference lies in the planets&rsquo; respective magnetic fields, because while Earth&rsquo;s magnetism comes from within, Mars&rsquo; does not.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Planetary magnetic fields</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Earth&rsquo;s magnetism comes from its core, where molten, electrically conducting iron flows beneath the crust. Its magnetic field is global, meaning it surrounds the entire planet. Since Mars is a rocky, terrestrial planet like Earth, one might assume that the same kind of magnetic paradigm functions there, too. However, Mars does not generate a magnetic field on its own, outside of relatively small patches of magnetized crust. Something different from what we observe on Earth must be happening on the Red Planet.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>What&rsquo;s going on above Mars?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The solar wind, made up largely of electrically charged electrons and protons, blows constantly from the Sun at around a million miles per hour. It flows around and interacts with the objects in our solar system. The solar wind is also magnetized and this magnetic field cannot easily penetrate the upper atmosphere of non-magnetized planets like Mars. Instead, currents that it induces in the planet&rsquo;s ionosphere cause a pile-up and strengthening of the magnetic field, creating a so-called induced magnetosphere. How the solar wind powers this induced magnetosphere at Mars has not been well understood until now.</p>\\n\\n<p>As solar wind ions and electrons smash into this stronger induced magnetic field near Mars, they are forced to flow apart due to their opposite electric charge. Some ions flow in one direction, some electrons in the other direction, forming electric currents that drape around from the dayside to the nightside of the planet. At the same time, solar x-rays and ultraviolet radiation constantly ionize some of the upper atmosphere on Mars, turning it into a combination of electrons and electrically charged ions that can conduct electricity.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/25002/maven-mars-electric-currents/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'MAVEN Mars Electric Currents: This image is from a scientific visualization of the electric currents around Mars.\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/25002_mavenmarselectriccurrents.png\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>MAVEN Mars Electric Currents</b>: This image is from a scientific visualization of the electric currents around Mars. Electric currents (blue and red arrows) envelop Mars in a nested, double-loop structure that wraps continuously around the planet from its day side to its night side.

Fortunately, the currents distort the magnetic fields in the solar wind, detectable by MAVEN&rsquo;s sensitive magnetometer. The team used MAVEN to map out the average magnetic field structure around Mars in three dimensions and calculated the currents directly from their distortions of the magnetic field structure.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;With a single elegant operation, the strength and paths of the currents pop out of this map of the magnetic field,&rdquo; Ramstad said.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Red Planet&rsquo;s destiny</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Without a global magnetic field surrounding Mars, the currents induced in the solar wind can form a direct electrical connection to the Martian upper atmosphere. The currents transform the energy of the solar wind into magnetic and electric fields that accelerate charged atmospheric particles into space, driving atmospheric escape to space. The new results reveal several unexpected features particular to MAVEN&rsquo;s goal to understand atmospheric escape: the energy that drives escape appears to be drawn from a much larger volume than was often assumed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Solar-wind-driven atmospheric loss has been active for billions of years and contributed to the transformation of Mars from a warm and wet planet that could have harbored life into a global cold desert. MAVEN is continuing to explore how this process works and how much of the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere has been lost.</p>\\n\\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission. MAVEN\\'s principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado\\'s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, Boulder, and NASA Goddard manages the MAVEN project.

They can also be detrimental to a spacecraft, at least when they\\'re at the level encountered atop the launch vehicle during liftoff. Those punishing decibels can actually cause parts and components to come loose.</p>\\n\\n<p>Long before the rover was shipped to Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for this summer\\'s launch, engineers put it in a special chamber at JPL and, using nitrogen-charged speakers, blasted away at it with random waves of sound as high as about 143 decibels &mdash; louder than what you\\'d encounter standing behind a roaring jet engine. On several occasions during the daylong acoustical test, they halted to inspect the rover and its surroundings, looking for anything that might have loosened, broken or fallen off. Some fasteners attaching spacecraft components had to be tightened and a few electrical cables replaced, but the mission team came away with increased confidence that while Perseverance will certainly be shaken during launch, nothing should stir.  </p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/detail_files/24987_PIA23887-AcousticTest-3rd-800.jpg\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Acoustic test for Perseverance\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24987_PIA23887-AcousticTest-3rd-800.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Mars Mission Sound Check: </b>The spacecraft that will carry NASA\\'s Perseverance rover to Mars is examined prior to an acoustic test in the Environmental Test Facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

At 70.5 feet (21.5 meters) in diameter, the rover\\'s supersonic parachute has everything to do with making that happen. A lot of work goes into ensuring a chute deploys right and can do the job without shredding or getting tangled.</p>\\n\\n<p>Perseverance\\'s parachute is based on the design successfully flown by Mars Curiosity in 2012. However, since Perseverance is slightly heavier than Curiosity, engineers strengthened their parachute design. But how to be sure it will do what is expected of it? Test, test, test.</p>\\n\\n<p>First, the team focused on verifying the chute would hold up under the strain of slowing a fast-moving spacecraft down in the Martian atmosphere. In the summer of 2017, they traveled to the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA\\'s Ames Research in California\\'s Silicon Valley to observe trial chute deployments close up in a wind tunnel, checking workmanship and looking for any unexpected behavior.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24989/wind-tunnel-testing-perseverances-parachute/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Testing the supersonic parachute \\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24989_PIA23916-800.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Wind Tunnel Testing Perseverance\\'s Parachute:</b> In this June 2017 photo, the supersonic parachute design that will land NASA\\'s Perseverance rover on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, undergoes testing in a wind tunnel at NASA\\'s Ames Research Center in California\\'s Silicon Valley.

The team tested the chute three times in Mars-relevant conditions, using Black Brant IX sounding rockets launched from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Research Facility in Virginia. The <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8380/third-aspire-test-confirms-mars-2020-parachute-a-go/\">final test flight</a>, on Sept. 7, exposed the chute to a 67,000-pound (37,000-kilogram) load &mdash; the highest ever survived by a supersonic parachute and about 85% higher than what the mission\\'s chute is expected to encounter during deployment in Mars\\' atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p>The team also tested the chute\\'s deployment mortar. Perseverance\\'s parachute is packed into an aluminum canister so tightly, it has the density of oak. The mortar is a cylindrical canister cradled atop the aeroshell, which encapsulates the rover. At the time of deployment, an explosive propellant at the base of the mortar will launch the carefully bundled array of nylon, Technora and Kevlar at just the right velocity and trajectory into the Martian slipstream.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mortar deployment evaluations took place in the winter of 2019 at a test facility in central Washington. The temperature of the mortar canister during the first test synched closely with the ambient air temperature &mdash; about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). The second and third were executed with the mortar chilled to minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 55 degrees Celsius) &mdash; well below the temperature at which the mortar is expected to fire during the actual deployment at Mars (14 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 10 degrees Centigrade).

The field site was also an opportunity for research: Besides simulating a rover, the field team members were studying the field site, providing insights that could help shape the search for past life on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>If a cliffside seemed promising, scientists on conference lines around the globe debated whether the field team should \"drive\" closer; if a set of rocks appeared ideal for preserving fossils, they would order close-up images from the field team. A ray-gun-like laser instrument mimicked Perseverance\\'s rock-analyzing <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8601/all-about-the-laser-and-microphone-atop-mars-2020-nasas-next-rover/\">SuperCam</a>; another handheld tool shot X-rays like the rover\\'s Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/pixl/\">PIXL</a>) will; a ground-penetrating radar was carted around in what looked like a jogger stroller to peer below the surface, mimicking the Radar Imager for Mars\\' Subsurface Experiment (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/rimfax/\">RIMFAX</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>The field team also had an important low-tech tool: a cheap broom used to sweep away their footprints, both to preserve the Martian feel of the landscape and to avoid providing the remote scientist a sense of scale in the rock images they were providing. </p>\\n\\n<p><b>A Patch of Mars in Nevada</b></p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\\'image_module right\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24953/stromatolites-in-the-nevada-desert/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'stromatolites in a dry lakebed\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24953_PIA23779-16.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Stromatolites in the Nevada Desert:</b> Made from fossilized microbes and sediment, these rounded rocks are stromatolites that were found in a dry lakebed during the field exercise.

The lake once extended much farther than it does today; the parts of it that dried up tens of thousands of years ago are now studded with stromatolites &mdash; collections of fossilized microbes and sediment that have hardened into what often look like bulbous, moundlike growths. It remains to be seen whether Jezero Crater, Perseverance\\'s landing site, has anything akin to stromatolites, but it, too, is an ancient lakebed.   </p>\\n\\n<p>Besides helping scientists think about biosignatures, or signs of ancient life, the training also demonstrated how working with Perseverance will take teamwork and careful coordination. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s especially important for scientists who are new to Mars rovers,\" said JPL scientist Raymond Francis, who led the field team. \"It\\'s a team effort, and everyone has to learn how their roles fit into the whole mission.\" </p>\\n\\n<p><b>One Rover, Many Decisions</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Lisa Mayhew, a geochemist and geomicrobiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, is one of those newcomers. To study the relationship between water, rocks and microbial life in extreme environments, she\\'s worked with deep-sea remotely operated vehicles, like the <a href=\"https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/explore/underwater-vehicles/ndsf-jason/\" target=\"_blank\">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\\'s Jason</a>. In places such as the Lost City, located at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, she\\'s watched Jason explore craggy mineral towers. Microbes in and on these towers thrive by metabolizing energy-rich gases, like hydrogen and methane, produced from reactions between water and rock. Some scientists think life on Earth may have originated in such places.</p>\\n\\n<p>Similarly to a Mars rover, Jason sends back images, and its robotic arms can be deployed to move rocks and take samples. But Mars is much farther away than the ocean floor. Only so many commands can be sent to Perseverance each day, and only so much data can be sent back. </p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24954/scientists-training-for-mars-rover-operations/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Scientists training in a conference room\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24954_PIA23780-16.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nScientists Training for Mars Rover Operations: Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory participate in a training exercise in February 2020.

But it does more than that, and so will Mastcam-Z: Along with producing images that enable the public to follow the rover\\'s daily discoveries, the cameras provide key data to help engineers navigate and scientists choose interesting rocks to study.

Images are taken through each and can be combined to produce stereo views. But the wide-angle lens takes in far more of the landscape in a single shot than the telescopic one; it requires up to nine telescopic images to match. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Perseverance\\'s Mastcam-Z simplifies matters, zooming both lenses until they match and can be used to make a single 3D image.

Chosen by NASA from the finalists for the agency\\'s \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/\">Name the Rover</a>\" contest for the Mars 2020 mission, Ingenuity is an apt description for the history-making spacecraft, which launches with NASA\\'s Perseverance rover this summer. Here, we ask Rupani what it\\'s like to be part of a pioneering experiment.    </p>\\n\\n<p><b>What was going through your head when you heard that the name you submitted for the rover would be used for the helicopter instead?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>I was very, very excited. To have a name I suggested used in any capacity is amazing. This helicopter is an incredible project, and I am thrilled to have a part in its journey.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Why do you think \"Ingenuity\" would be a good name for the helicopter?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Ingenuity would be a good name for the helicopter because that is exactly what it took to design this machine. The challenges faced trying to design something capable of flight on another planet can only be overcome with collaboration and creativity. It takes the ingenuity of an incredible group of people to create something with so many complex challenges.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>What excites you most about the Mars Helicopter? </b></p>\\n\\n<p>The fact that it will be the first craft to fly in a controlled way on another planet is super-exciting. Proving this is possible will open up multitudes of opportunities in space exploration. This milestone of adding an aerial element to the exploration of other worlds is extremely exciting!</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Why do you think space exploration is important? </b></p>\\n\\n<p>Space exploration is important because it gives us important insight into the history of planets. It tells us how different environments have changed over time and how they have reacted to different events. This information can then be used to protect Earth from any environmental dangers it may face, making space exploration extremely important to Earth\\'s health and survival.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Bonus question for Vaneeza\\'s mom, Nausheen Rupani: What&rsquo;s an interesting story you can share about your daughter that\\'s related to space?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Vaneeza had an interest in space science since her Montessori years. On their way to school every day, she and her dad would pretend they were in a spaceship. They would imagine seeing planets (buildings), stars (traffic lights), etc. on their way and give them names.</p>\\n\\n<p>Space and the science of engineering that answers our questions about it have always fascinated Vaneeza since she learned to express herself.

For several months following the rover\\'s landing, Ingenuity will remain encapsulated in a protective cover to shield it from debris during <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/timeline/entry-descent-landing/\">entry, descent and landing</a>. When the timing in the rover mission is right, Ingenuity will be deployed to stand and operate on its own on the surface of the Red Planet. If the 4-pound (2-kilogram), solar-powered craft &mdash; a combination of specially designed components and off-the-shelf parts &mdash; survives the cold Martian nights during its pre-flight checkout, the team will proceed with testing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If successful during its 30-Martian-day (31-Earth-day) experimental flight test window, the small craft will prove that powered flight can be achieved at Mars, enabling future Mars missions to better utilize second-generation helicopters to add an aerial dimension to their explorations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The helicopter successfully completed its flight-testing program using the 25-foot space simulation chamber at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The next flight attempt will be in the actual environment of Mars. And if Ingenuity encounters difficulties, engineers will apply the lessons learned to future technology demonstrations. The science-gathering portion of the Mars 2020 mission will not be impacted.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"In the early days of this project, the feasibility of flying at Mars was questioned,\" said MiMi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager at JPL. \"But today we have a helicopter down at the launch site, installed on the rover and waiting to board the rocket which will carry us to the Red Planet.

Owing to planetary alignment, the only time to launch a large payload to Earth\\'s second closest planetary neighbor occurs just three weeks out of every 26 months. If Perseverance doesn\\'t make it off the launch pad before the end of this launch opportunity, the project will have to wait until September 2022 to try again.

Like all of us, they worry about their families and communities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However, by staying focused on the challenge at hand, preparation for the launch of Perseverance &mdash; humanity\\'s first step in returning samples from another planet &mdash; remains on track. Getting to this point has required the team to be nimble, adhere to necessary health precautions, and gather support across the agency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Persevering at Home </b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Based at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the project has transitioned 90% of the team to telework.

Like many Americans, they are persevering from home.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The team created a community page to share thoughts on best practices and provide moral support to each other. They\\'ve changed their meeting cadence, making time for \"hallway conversations.\" They\\'re also making time for \"virtual walk-ins\" and one-on-one virtual exchanges with project management.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But for some critical spacecraft tasks, a physical presence in a laboratory setting is required. Just last week at JPL, mission-essential staff successfully completed the assembly and cleaning of the sample tubes that will hold Martian sediment and rock for return to Earth on a future mission.

The same holds true for the team behind NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover. They\\'re dealing with the same challenges of so many remote workers &mdash; quieting the dog, sharing space with partners and family, remembering to step away from the desk from time to time &mdash; but with a twist: They\\'re operating on Mars. </p>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<p>On March 20, 2020, nobody on the team was present at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, where the mission is based. It was the first time the rover\\'s operations were planned while the team was completely remote. Two days later, the commands they had sent to Mars executed as expected, resulting in Curiosity <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/8633/sols-2713-2714-check-your-work/\">drilling a rock sample</a> at a location called \"Edinburgh.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The team began to anticipate the need to go fully remote a couple weeks before, leading them to rethink how they would operate. Headsets, monitors and other equipment were distributed (picked up curbside, with all employees following proper social-distancing measures). </p>\\n\\n<p>Not everything they\\'re used to working with at JPL could be sent home, however: Planners rely on 3D images from Mars and usually study them through special goggles that rapidly shift between left- and right-eye views to better reveal the contours of the landscape. That helps them figure out where to drive Curiosity and how far they can extend its robotic arm. </p>\\n\\n<p>But those goggles require the advanced graphics cards in high-performance computers at JPL (they\\'re actually gaming computers repurposed for driving on Mars). In order for rover operators to view 3D images on ordinary laptops, they\\'ve switched to simple red-blue 3D glasses. Although not as immersive or comfortable as the goggles, they work just as well for planning drives and arm movements.</p>\\n\\n<p>The team ran through several tests and one full practice run before it was time to plan the \"Edinburgh\" drilling operation.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>What It Takes to Drive a Rover</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, hardware is only part of the equation: A great deal of logistical adjustments are required as well. Typically, team members at JPL work with hundreds of scientists at research institutions around the world to decide where to drive Curiosity and how to gather its science. Working at a remove from those scientists is not new. But working apart from other people who are usually based at JPL is. </p>\\n\\n<p>Programming each sequence of actions for the rover may involve 20 or so people developing and testing commands in one place while chatting with dozens of others located elsewhere. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'re usually all in one room, sharing screens, images and data. People are talking in small groups and to each other from across the room,\" said Alicia Allbaugh, who leads the team. </p>\\n\\n<p><span>Now they do the same job by holding several video conferences at once while also relying more on messaging apps. </span>It takes extra effort to make sure everybody understands one another; on average, each day\\'s planning takes one or two more hours than it normally would. That adds some limits to how many commands are sent each day. But for the most part, Curiosity is as scientifically productive as ever.</p>\\n\\n<p>To make sure everyone is being heard and understands one another, science operations team chief Carrie Bridge proactively talks to the scientists and engineers to close any communication gaps: Does anyone see issues with the current plan? Does the solution the engineers are converging around work for the scientists?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"I probably monitor about 15 chat channels at all times,\" she said. \"You\\'re juggling more than you normally would.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Typically, Bridge would make her rounds to several groups working in a kind of situation room where Curiosity\\'s data and images are viewed and commands are generated. Now she calls into as many as four separate videoconferences at the same time to check in. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"I still do my normal routine, but virtually,\" she said. </p>\\n\\n<p>The transition has taken getting used to, but Bridge said the effort to keep Curiosity rolling is representative of the can-do spirit that attracted her to NASA.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s classic, textbook NASA,\" she said. \"We\\'re presented with a problem and we figure out how to make things work. Mars isn\\'t standing still for us; we\\'re still exploring.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information about Curiosity, visit:</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://nasa.gov/msl\"><b>https://nasa.gov/msl</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8647_PIA23773-32x24.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8647_PIA23773-800w.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8645, 'title': \"Mars Helicopter Attached to NASA's Perseverance Rover\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': \"The Mars Helicopter attached to the belly of NASA's Perseverance\", 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': 'Perseverance,rover,clean room,sky crane,launch,helicopter', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-04-10T17:34:50.705Z', 'url': '/news/8645/mars-helicopter-attached-to-nasas-perseverance-rover/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program'], [180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[19, 'press', 'Press Releases']], 'description': \"The team also fueled the rover's sky crane to get ready for this summer's history-making launch.\", 'date': 'April 10, 2020', 'body': '<hr />\\n<p><i>The team also fueled the rover\\'s sky crane to get ready for this summer\\'s history-making launch.</i></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p>With the launch period of NASA\\'s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover opening in 14 weeks, final preparations of the spacecraft continue at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

His uncle wrote to the U.S. Consulate, asking for information about NASA and space exploration. The bulging envelope they sent back, stuffed with glossy booklets, entranced young Bob. His interest in space was piqued further by listening to the Moon landing on the radio. \"I gobbled it up,\" he says. \"Long before the internet, the U.S. had good outreach. You had my eyeballs.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>His active brain and fertile imagination focused on getting an education, which would lead him to a bachelor\\'s degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, a master\\'s and Ph.D. in computer and systems engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and a career at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. That\\'s where he has remained for 35 years as a robotics technologist. </p>\\n\\n<p>Balaram\\'s career has encompassed robotic arms, early Mars rovers, technology for a notional balloon mission to explore Venus and a stint as lead for the Mars Science Laboratory entry, descent and landing simulation software. </p>\\n\\n<p><span><div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22373_PIA23161-16.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Monitoring the Mars Helicopter\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22373_PIA23161-16.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n</span><b>Monitoring the Mars Helicopter:</b><span> Teddy Tzanetos, MiMi Aung and Bob Balaram of NASA&rsquo;s Mars Helicopter project observe a flight test.

In the 1990s, Balaram attended a professional conference, where Stanford professor Ilan Kroo spoke about a \"mesicopter,\" a miniature airborne vehicle for Earth applications that was funded as a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts proposal.</p>\\n\\n<p>This led Balaram to think about using one on Mars. He suggested a joint proposal with Stanford for a NASA Research Announcement submission and recruited AeroVironment, a small company in Simi Valley, California. The proposal got favorable reviews, and although it was not selected for funding at that time, it did yield a blade-rotor test under Mars conditions at JPL. Other than that, the idea \"sat on a shelf\" for 15 years. </p>\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to a conference where the University of Pennsylvania presented about the use of drones and helicopters. Charles Elachi, then director of JPL, attended that session. When he returned to JPL, he asked whether something like this could be used on Mars. A colleague of Balaram\\'s mentioned his previous work in that area of research. Balaram dusted off that proposal, and Elachi asked him to write a new one for the competitive call for Mars 2020 investigation payloads. This sped up the process of developing a concept. </p>\\n\\n<p>Balaram and his team had eight weeks to submit a proposal. Working day and night, they met the deadline with two weeks to spare. </p>\\n\\n<p>Although the helicopter idea was not selected as an instrument, it was funded for technology development and risk reduction. Mimi Aung became Mars Helicopter project manager, and after the team worked on risk reduction, NASA decided to fund the helicopter for flight as a technology demonstration.</p>\\n\\n<p><span><div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22365_PIA23151-16.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Portrait of NASA\\'s Mars Helicopter\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22365_PIA23151-16.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n</span><b>Portrait of NASA\\'s Mars Helicopter:</b><span> This image of the flight model of NASA&rsquo;s Mars Helicopter was taken on Feb. 14, 2019, in a cleanroom at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Balaram describes it as a perfectly blank canvas, but with restrictions. His physics background helped him envision flying on Mars, a planet with an atmosphere that is only 1% as dense as Earth\\'s. He compares it to flying on Earth at a 100,000-foot (30,500-meter) altitude &mdash; about seven times higher than a typical terrestrial helicopter can fly. Another challenge was that the copter could carry only a few kilograms, including the weight of batteries and a radio for communications. \"You can\\'t just throw mass at it, because it needed to fly,\" he says.</p>\\n\\n<p>It dawned on Balaram that it was like building a new kind of aircraft that just happens to be a spacecraft. And because it is a \"passenger\" on a flagship mission, he says, \"we have to guarantee 100% that it will be safe.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The end result: a 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) helicopter with two pairs of light counter-rotating blades &mdash; an upper and lower pair, to slice through the Martian atmosphere. Each pair of blades spans 4 feet (1.2 meters) in diameter.</p>\\n\\n<p>Once it was built, Balaram says, the question was, \"How do you test this beast? There\\'s no book saying how.\" Because there is no easily accessible place on Earth with a thin atmosphere like the one on Mars, they ran tests in a vacuum chamber and the 25-foot Space Simulation Chamber at JPL. </p>\\n\\n<p>About two-and-a-half months after landing at Jezero Crater, the Mars Helicopter team will have a window of about 30 days to perform a technology demonstration in the actual environment of the planet, starting with a series of vehicle checkouts, followed by attempts of first-ever flights in the very thin Martian atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p>Despite best efforts and the best tests available on Earth, this is a high-risk, high-reward technology demonstration, with Balaram saying quite frankly, \"We could fail.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>But if this \"crazy idea\" succeeds on Mars, it will be what Balaram describes as \"kind of a Wright Brothers moment on another planet\" &mdash; the first time a powered aircraft will have flown on Mars, or any planet besides Earth, for that matter. This potential breakthrough could help pave the way for future craft that would expand NASA\\'s portfolio of vehicles to explore other worlds.</p>\\n\\n<p>And partly because there have been so many challenges along the way, it\\'s a testament to the dedication, vision, persistence and attitude of Balaram and his colleagues that the Mars Helicopter concept was funded, planned, developed and built and is heading to the Red Planet this summer.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Bob is the inventor of our Mars Helicopter. He innovated the design and followed up on that vision to its fruition as chief engineer through all phases of design, development and test,\" says project manager Aung. \"Whenever we encountered a technical roadblock &mdash; and we encountered many roadblocks &mdash; we always turned to Bob, who always carries an inexhaustible set of potential solutions to be considered. Come to think of it, I don\\'t think I have ever seen Bob feeling stuck at any point!\" </p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Home Stretch Toward Mars</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The main purpose of the Mars 2020 mission is to deliver the Perseverance rover, which will not only continue to explore the past habitability of the planet, but will actually search for signs of ancient microbial life. It will also cache rock and soil samples for pickup by a potential future mission and help pave the way for future human exploration of Mars. Even if the helicopter encounters difficulties, the science-gathering mission of the Perseverance rover won\\'t be affected. </p>\\n\\n<p>Balaram points out that in addition to the usual \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/20049/challenges-of-getting-to-mars-curiositys-seven-minutes-of-terror/\">seven minutes of terror</a>\" experienced by the team on Earth during a Mars landing, once the helicopter is on Mars and attempting to fly, \"This is the seven seconds of terror every time we take off or land.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Does Balaram worry about all this, even a little? \"There\\'s been a crisis every single week of the last six years,\" he says. \"I\\'m used to it.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Balaram sheds any stress that may crop up through backpacking, hiking and massage. There\\'s also his very supportive wife, Sandy, who bears a title within the team and her own acronym: CMO, or Chief Morale Officer. She has regularly baked cakes, pies and other goodies for Balaram to share with his colleagues for sustenance during the long process.</p>\\n\\n<p>And he has high praise for his teammates on the Mars Helicopter project, saying the people attracted to it are agile and fast-moving. \"It\\'s a great team, determined to dare mighty things &mdash; that\\'s the fun part,\" Balaram says. His take on daring mighty things: \"Good ideas don\\'t die &mdash; they just take a while.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>DC Agle<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-9011<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:agle@jpl.nasa.gov\">agle@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Written by Jane Platt</p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8639_bob-heli-226.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8639_bob-heli-16.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8634, 'title': \"10.9 Million Names Now Aboard NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'A placard commemorating NASA\\'s \"Send Your Name to Mars\" campaign was installed on the Persevarnce Mars rover', 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-03-26T21:06:43.177Z', 'url': '/news/8634/109-million-names-now-aboard-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program'], [180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[19, 'press', 'Press Releases']], 'description': \"As part of NASA's 'Send Your Name to Mars' campaign, they've been stenciled onto three microchips along with essays from NASA's 'Name the Rover' contest.

And before doing that, the rover took a selfie, capturing the scene just below Greenheugh.</p>\\n\\n<p>In front of the rover is a hole it drilled while sampling a bedrock target called \"Hutton.\" The entire selfie is a 360-degree panorama stitched together from 86 images relayed to Earth. The selfie captures the rover about 11 feet (3.4 meters) below the point where it climbed onto the crumbling pediment.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity finally reached the top of the slope March 6 (the 2,696th Martian day, or sol, of the mission). It took three drives to scale the hill, the second of which <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/8620/sol-2693-have-we-broken-a-record-not-so-fast-says-opportunity/\">tilted the rover 31 degrees</a> &mdash; the most the rover has ever tilted on Mars and just shy of the now-inactive Opportunity rover\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1901/rover-takes-on-steepest-slope-ever-tried-on-mars/\">32-degree tilt record</a>, set in 2016. Curiosity took the selfie on Feb. 26, 2020 (Sol 2687).</p>\\n\\n<p>Since 2014, Curiosity has been rolling up Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain at the center of Gale Crater. Rover operators at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California carefully map out each drive to make sure Curiosity will be safe. The rover is never in danger of tilting so much that it would flip over &mdash; <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/rover/wheels/\">Curiosity\\'s rocker-bogie wheel system enables it to tilt up to 45 degrees safely</a> &mdash; but the steep drives do cause the wheels to spin in place.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>How Are Selfies Taken?</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Before the climb, Curiosity used the black-and-white Navigation Cameras located on its mast to, for the first time, record a short movie of its \"selfie stick,\" otherwise known as its robotic arm.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity\\'s mission is to study whether the Martian environment could have supported microbial life billions of years ago. One tool for doing that is the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/mahli/\">Mars Hand Lens Camera</a>, or MAHLI, located in the turret at the end of the robotic arm. This camera provides a close-up view of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw-images/?order=sol+desc%2Cinstrument_sort+asc%2Csample_type_sort+asc%2C+date_taken+desc&per_page=50&page=0&mission=msl&af=MAHLI%2C%2C\">sand grains and rock textures</a>, similarly to how a geologist uses a handheld magnifying glass for a closer look in the field on Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>By rotating the turret to face the rover, the team can use MAHLI to show Curiosity. Because each MAHLI image covers only a small area, it requires many images and arm positions to fully capture the rover and its surroundings.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We get asked so often how Curiosity takes a selfie,\" said Doug Ellison, a Curiosity camera operator at JPL. \"We thought the best way to explain it would be to let the rover show everyone from its own point of view just how it\\'s done.\"</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\'column-width embedded_video video_player_container\\'>\\n<div class=\\'video_wrapper\\'>\\n<iframe width=\"840\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_ii2GABPao?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Navcam Movie of How Curiosity Takes a Selfie</b>: This video, taken by one of the Navigation Cameras, or Navcams, on NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover, shows the rover\\'s robotic arm as it rotates to take a selfie.

It\\'s been over a month since engineers have heard from MarCO, which followed NASA\\'s InSight to the Red Planet. At this time, the mission team considers it unlikely they\\'ll be heard from again.</p>\\n\\n<p>MarCO, short for Mars Cube One, was the first interplanetary mission to use a class of mini-spacecraft called <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/834/10-things-cubesats-going-farther/\" target=\"_blank\">CubeSats</a>. The MarCOs &mdash; nicknamed EVE and WALL-E, after characters from a Pixar film &mdash; served as communications relays during InSight\\'s landing, beaming back data at each stage of its descent to the Martian surface in near-real time, along with <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22159/insights-first-image-from-mars/?site=insight\">InSight\\'s first image</a>. WALL-E sent back <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8394/nasa-hears-marco-cubesats-loud-and-clear-from-mars/?site=insight\">stunning images</a> of Mars as well, while EVE performed some simple radio science.</p>\\n\\n<p>All of this was achieved with experimental technology that cost a fraction of what most space missions do: $18.5 million provided by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which built the CubeSats.</p>\\n\\n<p>WALL-E was last heard from on Dec. 29; EVE, on Jan. 4. Based on trajectory calculations, WALL-E is currently more than 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) past Mars; EVE is farther, almost 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) past Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mission team has several theories for why they haven\\'t been able to contact the pair. WALL-E has a leaky thruster. Attitude-control issues could be causing them to wobble and lose the ability to send and receive commands. The brightness sensors that allow the CubeSats to stay pointed at the Sun and recharge their batteries could be another factor. The MarCOs are in orbit around the Sun and will only get farther away as February wears on. The farther they are, the more precisely they need to point their antennas to communicate with Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>The MarCOs won\\'t start moving toward the Sun again until this summer. The team will reattempt to contact the CubeSats at that time, though it\\'s anyone\\'s guess whether their batteries and other parts will last that long.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even if they\\'re never revived, the team considers MarCO a spectacular success.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us,\" said Andy Klesh, the mission\\'s chief engineer at JPL. \"We\\'ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>A number of the critical spare parts for each MarCO will be used in other CubeSat missions.

SEIS has found more than 450 seismic signals to date, the vast majority of which are probably quakes (as opposed to data noise created by environmental factors, like wind). The largest quake was about magnitude 4.0 in size &mdash; not quite large enough to travel down below the crust into the planet\\'s lower mantle and core.

A pair of quakes was strongly linked to one such region, Cerberus Fossae, where scientists see boulders that may have been shaken down cliffsides. Ancient floods there <a href=\"/resources/24785\">carved channels</a> nearly 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) long. Lava flows then seeped into those channels within the past 10 million years &mdash; the blink of an eye in geologic time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some of these young lava flows show signs of having been fractured by quakes less than 2 million years ago. \"It\\'s just about the youngest tectonic feature on the planet,\" said planetary geologist Matt Golombek of JPL. \"The fact that we\\'re seeing evidence of shaking in this region isn\\'t a surprise, but it\\'s very cool.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>At the Surface</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Billions of years ago, Mars had a magnetic field. It is no longer present, but it left ghosts behind, magnetizing ancient rocks that are now between 200 feet (61 meters) to several miles below ground. InSight is equipped with a magnetometer &mdash; the first on the surface of Mars to detect magnetic signals.</p>\\n\\n<p>The magnetometer has found that the signals at Homestead hollow are 10 times stronger than what was predicted based on data from orbiting spacecraft that study the area. The measurements of these orbiters are averaged over a couple of hundred miles, whereas InSight\\'s measurements are more local.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because most surface rocks at InSight\\'s location are too young to have been magnetized by the planet\\'s former field, \"this magnetism must be coming from ancient rocks underground,\" said Catherine Johnson, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and the Planetary Science Institute. \"We\\'re combining these data with what we know from seismology and geology to understand the magnetized layers below InSight. How strong or deep would they have to be for us to detect this field?\"</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition, scientists are intrigued by how these signals change over time. The measurements vary by day and night; they also tend to pulse around midnight. Theories are still being formed as to what causes such changes, but one possibility is that they\\'re related to the solar wind interacting with the Martian atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>In the Wind</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight measures wind speed, direction and air pressure nearly continuously, offering more data than previous landed missions. The spacecraft\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/\">weather sensors</a> have detected thousands of passing whirlwinds, which are called dust devils when they pick up grit and become visible. \"This site has more whirlwinds than any other place we\\'ve landed on Mars while carrying weather sensors,\" said Aymeric Spiga, an atmospheric scientist at Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>\\n\\n<p>Despite all that activity and frequent imaging, InSight\\'s cameras have yet to see dust devils. But SEIS can feel these whirlwinds pulling on the surface like a giant vacuum cleaner. \"Whirlwinds are perfect for subsurface seismic exploration,\" said Philippe Lognonn&eacute; of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), principal investigator of SEIS.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Still to Come: The Core</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight has two radios: one for regularly sending and receiving data, and a more powerful radio designed to measure the \"wobble\" of Mars as it spins. This X-band radio, also known as the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE), can eventually reveal whether the planet\\'s core is solid or liquid. A solid core would cause Mars to wobble less than a liquid one would.</p>\\n\\n<p>This first year of data is just a start.

The InSight team has since determined that the soil here is different than what has been encountered on other parts of Mars. InSight landed in an area with an unusually thick duricrust, or a layer of cemented soil. Rather than being loose and sandlike, as expected, the dirt granules stick together.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mole needs friction from soil in order to travel downward; without it, recoil from its self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place. Ironically, loose soil, not duricrust, provides that friction as it falls around the mole.</p>\\n\\n<p>This past summer, the InSight team started using the robotic arm\\'s scoop to press on the side of the mole, a technique called \"pinning\" that added just enough friction to help it dig without coming in contact with the fragile science tether connected to the mole\\'s back cap.   </p>\\n\\n<p>While pinning helped, the mole popped back out of the Martian soil on two occasions, possibly from soil building up from beneath. With few alternatives left, the team has decided to try helping the mole dig by carefully pressing on its back cap while attempting to avoid the tether.</p>\\n\\n<p>It might take several tries to perfect the back-cap push, just as pinning did. Throughout late February and early March, InSight\\'s arm will be maneuvered into position so that the team can test what happens as the mole briefly hammers.</p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, the team is also considering using the scoop to move more soil into the hole that has formed around the mole. This could add more pressure and friction, allowing it to finally dig down. Whether they pursue this route depends on how deep the mole is able to travel after the back-cap push.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

The support structure of HP3 was outfitted with a knob, or \"grapple point,\" that the robotic arm can grasp in order to move it from the lander\\'s deck onto the Martian surface. Designed to be housed within the support structure, the mole itself has no grapple point and was not intended to be grasped or moved.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even if the mole <i>could</i> be moved, relocating it would be an unlikely solution. The team is confident that the probe has been unable to dig because the soil doesn\\'t provide enough friction. Anywhere you move the mole near the lander would likely pose the same problem. The strategy of \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8518/nasas-push-to-save-the-mars-insight-landers-heat-probe/?site=insight\">pinning</a>\" &mdash; pressing the robotic arm\\'s scoop against the side of the mole &mdash; compensates for that lack of friction and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAInSight/status/1186328153469272072\"> helped the mole</a> progress downward in early October.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why doesn\\'t the mole include a drill?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> A drill would require a much bigger, more powerful motor than what the InSight lander can accommodate. It would also require more power than the solar-powered lander can practically provide. What\\'s more, a drill would require rigging to stabilize it as the motor spins, just like with a drill press. Rigging cancels out the force of a drill\\'s spin, which would otherwise spin the motor in the other direction.</p>\\n\\n<p>About 1 inch (2.7 centimeters) in diameter and about 16 inches (40 centimeters) long, the mole was designed to be light enough and small enough to suit the constraints of the lander deck. It functions somewhat like a pile driver: A motor attached to a gearbox inside the mole slowly compresses and then quickly releases a spring that drives a tungsten hammer against the interior of the mole tip, at a pace of one stroke every 3.7 seconds.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Are you sure the mole didn\\'t hit a rock?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> Most of the team remains confident that a rock didn\\'t cause the mole to rebound. The landing site, Elysium Planitia, was selected partly because it has so few visible rocks, implying few large subsurface rocks. The mole is strong enough to nudge small rocks out of its way and was designed to go around medium-size rocks &mdash; anything less than about 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter &mdash; once it\\'s fully buried.</p>\\n\\n<p>Further analysis will be required to determine why the mole backed out of the hole once there was too little mole exposed above the Martian surface to make pinning possible.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: How much of a factor is Mars\\' reduced gravity when trying to replicate the mole&rsquo;s behavior on Earth?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> The<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZSXnw-fJbGk\"> robotic arm testbed</a> at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, uses weight models (nonfunctional replicas of the instruments that are the weight they would be on Mars) to simulate the effects of the Red Planet\\'s reduced gravity. But certain experiments, like ones involving the mole digging, cannot be fully re-created: The team can\\'t simulate low gravity at the Earth\\'s surface. It wouldn\\'t be possible to make a lightweight version of the mole for testing that has the same digging power as the mole that\\'s on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Is there any chance the hammering mechanism is damaged?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> The InSight science team hasn\\'t seen any noticeable difference between the performance of the mole on Mars and what has been seen in testing on Earth. InSight\\'s seismometer can detect the vibrations from each of the mole\\'s hammer strokes and is being used to analyze tiny (millisecond-level) variations in each stroke. To date, the team hasn\\'t seen evidence that the hammering mechanism is damaged.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Despite the challenges it poses to the mole, is the soil teaching us anything new about Mars?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> Absolutely! The mole was designed with the loose, sandy soils seen by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in mind. The soil under InSight is mechanically different from what we\\'ve seen at other landing sites. The formation of the pit around the probe, the resistance of the pit to collapsing and the interesting self-extraction of the mole are all surprising and will be investigated by the InSight science team to revise its understanding of the formation and variations of the Martian soil.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why push the mole from the side rather than applying pressure from above?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> Pushing from the side allowed the InSight team to almost fully bury the mole in October 2019; it\\'s a technique that appears to work well. The team wants to avoid pressing on top of the mole, where a sensitive tether supplying power and relaying data sticks out. It\\'s still possible that the team will press down on the top of the mole if there are no other options, but they have been pressing from the side until now because it\\'s safer for all of the hardware.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p><b><i>Originally posted June 5, 2019</i></b></p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s a <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8445/insights-team-tries-new-strategy-to-help-the-mole/?site=insight\">new plan</a> to get InSight\\'s \"mole\" moving again.

That\\'s why we want to lift the support structure. But we\\'re fairly confident the problem is a lack of friction in the soil.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mole is designed for loose soil to flow around it, providing friction that keeps the mole from bouncing backwards with recoil. The soil around InSight provides much less friction than what we\\'ve seen before on Mars. We have several ideas for why this is. One is that the soil compacts and holds together so well that the mole may have created a small cavity around itself while hammering, preventing it from getting the friction it needs to dig. <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/content/en/articles/news/2019/02/20190411_tests-for-the-insight-mole.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tests conducted in Germany have confirmed this could happen</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s also the possibility that we\\'ve hit a rock. The mole was designed to go around smaller rocks &mdash; no bigger than a few inches [or centimeters] in size &mdash; but it may be pinned between the rock and the support structure. If that\\'s the case, moving the support structure may allow it to keep digging. If it\\'s hit a larger rock, there\\'s not much we can do.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why couldn\\'t the team anticipate the soil issue or hitting a rock?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We always knew there were environmental risks that could stop the mole. What we did is prepare as best we could so that they were calculated risks.</p>\\n\\n<p>The low-friction soil was unexpected: Everywhere else on Mars, soil has been different, which was what the mole was built for. We also knew there would be rocks underground, so we deliberately chose a landing site that was flat and had as few rocks as possible on the surface. Based on what we can see, the chances of hitting a rock this close to the surface that the mole can\\'t go around is only a few percent.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: What will happen once you lift the support structure?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> It depends on what we see. First, we\\'ll try a short hammering sequence with the mole. Then, regardless of whether there\\'s a cavity around the mole, we will likely press on the soil with a small scoop on the robotic arm to provide a load on the surface. Our calculations suggest that this should increase the friction and could help it dig.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: When would that occur?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We hope to lift the support structure by the end of June and to have our next steps decided by mid-July. After that, we will need time to run more tests.</p>\\n\\n<p><i>Engineer-scientist Troy Hudson of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the InSight mission.</i></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why are you lifting the support structure in three steps?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> There are springs inside of the support structure that may still be in contact with the top of the mole. If that\\'s the case, we want to be careful lifting the structure so that we don\\'t accidentally pull the mole out. If that happened, we won\\'t be able to insert it back into its hole in the soil. So we\\'ll lift the support structure a little bit at a time, checking to make sure the mole isn\\'t coming with it.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why has it taken so much time to plan these next steps?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We don\\'t want to take an action that makes the situation worse, so we\\'ve been moving very carefully. InSight is also a Discovery class mission, meaning it was meant to be more affordable &mdash; and to accept more risk &mdash; than a flagship NASA mission. So the team is very small; we don\\'t command the lander every day, and commands that are sent up need to be rigorously tested to make sure they\\'ll work the way we want them to. We want every action to be safe for HP3, the robotic arm <i>and</i> InSight\\'s seismometer, which is very close by.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p><b>\\u200b</b><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

During the hiatus, other orbiters will relay data from the Mars Curiosity rover and Mars InSight lander to Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>The maintenance work involves updating battery parameters in the spacecraft\\'s flash memory - a rare step that\\'s been done <a href=\"/news/1867/mission-nearing-decade-at-mars-finishes-memory-update/\">only twice before</a> in the orbiter\\'s 15 years of flight. This special update is necessary because it was recently determined that the battery parameters in flash were out of date and if used, would not charge MRO\\'s batteries to the desired levels.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the battery parameters, engineers will use this opportunity to update planetary position tables that also reside in flash. The spacecraft will go into a precautionary standby mode, called safe mode, three times over the course of the update. It will also swap from its primary computer, called its Side-A computer, to its redundant one, called Side-B.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter launched in 2005 and arrived at the Red Planet on March 10, 2006. Since then, the spacecraft has returned 371 terabits of data. Long-lived spacecraft need to guard against failures of aging hardware and the effects of the harsh space environment, such as damage from cosmic rays.</p>\\n\\n<p>Whenever a spacecraft detects a technical issue, there\\'s a series of actions it can take, including swapping to a redundant side of its electronics or rebooting its computer. Success in those cases depends upon restoring an uncorrupted, up-to-date version of an operating system with its parameter files from flash memory. To guard against corruption of the flash memory itself, multiple copies of essential parameters are stored onboard.</p>\\n\\n<p>To keep both of the redundant computers up to date, engineers will update the flash on the Side-A computer first and then command a Side-A reboot to ensure that the flash memory was properly updated. Once they confirm the changes have taken effect, they\\'ll swap to Side-B and repeat the process. </p>\\n\\n<p>After validation of the memory updates, MRO will return to its science and relay-support activities. With this update, the mission will be poised to continue operations well into the next decade.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more about MRO:</p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/mission/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/mission/index.html</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8609_list_image.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8609_main_image.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8607, 'title': \"NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Goes Coast-to-Coast to Prep for Launch\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'Seeing the Mars 2020 Rover Off', 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-02-15T19:25:56.286Z', 'url': '/news/8607/nasas-mars-2020-rover-goes-coast-to-coast-to-prep-for-launch/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program'], [180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[165, 'feature', 'Feature Stories']], 'description': \"The agency's first step in returning rocks from Mars just arrived at Kennedy Space Center.

Part of the Deep Space Network (DSN), the 112-foot-wide (34-meter-wide) antenna dish being built represents a future in which more missions will require advanced technology, such as lasers capable of transmitting vast amounts of data from astronauts on the Martian surface. As part of its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/artemisprogram\">Artemis program</a> NASA will send the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024, applying lessons learned there to send astronauts to Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>Using massive antenna dishes, the agency talks to more than 30 deep space missions on any given day, including many international missions. As more missions have launched and with more in the works, NASA is looking to strengthen the network. When completed in 2&frac12; years, the new dish will be christened Deep Space Station-23 (DSS-23), bringing the DSN\\'s number of operational antennas to 13.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Since the 1960s, when the world first watched live pictures of humans in space and on the Moon, to revealing imagery and scientific data from the surface of Mars and vast, distant galaxies, the Deep Space Network has connected humankind with our solar system and beyond,\" said Badri Younes, NASA\\'s deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation, or SCaN, which oversees NASA\\'s networks. \"This new antenna, the fifth of six currently planned, is another example of NASA\\'s determination to enable science and space exploration through the use of the latest technology.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Managed by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the world\\'s largest and busiest deep space network is clustered in three locations - Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia - that are positioned approximately 120 degrees apart around the globe to enable continual contact with spacecraft as the Earth rotates. (<a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/\" target=\"_blank\">This live tool</a> lets viewers see which DSN dishes are sending up commands or receiving data at any given time.)</p>\\n\\n<p>The first addition to Goldstone since 2003, the new dish is being built at the complex\\'s Apollo site, so named because its DSS-16 antenna supported NASA\\'s human missions to the Moon. Similar antennas have been built in recent years in Canberra, while two are under construction in Madrid.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The DSN is Earth\\'s one phone line to our two Voyager spacecraft - both in interstellar space - all our Mars missions and the New Horizons spacecraft that is now far past Pluto,\" said JPL Deputy Director Larry James. \"The more we explore, the more antennas we need to talk to all our missions.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>While DSS-23 will function as a radio antenna, it will also be equipped with mirrors and a special receiver for lasers beamed from distant spacecraft. This technology is critical for sending astronauts to places like Mars. Humans there will need to communicate with Earth more than NASA\\'s robotic explorers do, and a Mars base, with its life support systems and equipment, would buzz with data that needs to be monitored.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Lasers can increase your data rate from Mars by about 10 times what you get from radio,\" said Suzanne Dodd, director of the Interplanetary Network, the organization that manages the DSN. \"Our hope is that providing a platform for optical communications will encourage other space explorers to experiment with lasers on future missions.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>While clouds can disrupt lasers, Goldstone\\'s clear desert skies make it an ideal location to serve as a laser receiver about 60% of the time. A demonstration of DSS-23\\'s capabilities is around the corner: When NASA launches an orbiter called Psyche to a metallic asteroid in a few years, it will carry an experimental laser communications terminal developed by JPL. Called the Deep Space Optical Communications project, this equipment will send data and images to an observatory at Southern California\\'s Palomar Mountain. But Psyche will also be able to communicate with the new Goldstone antenna, paving the way for higher data rates in deep space.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information:</p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><b>https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Kathryn Hambleton<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1100<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov\">kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8606_list_image.jpg', 'main_image': '/assets/public/missing.png', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8603, 'title': 'NASA Administrator Statement on Moon to Mars Initiative, FY 2021 Budget', 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine delivers the State of NASA address', 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': 'MSR, Mars, future, budget, sample return', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2020-02-11T01:04:07.328Z', 'url': '/news/8603/nasa-administrator-statement-on-moon-to-mars-initiative-fy-2021-budget/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program']], 'news_type': [[19, 'press', 'Press Releases']], 'description': \"Jim Bridenstine addresses NASA's ambitious plans for the coming years, including Mars Sample Return.\", 'date': 'February 10, 2020', 'body': '<p>\"President Donald Trump\\'s Fiscal Year 2021 budget for NASA is worthy of 21st century exploration and discovery.

The reinforced support from the President comes at a critical time as we lay the foundations for landing the first woman and the next man on the South Pole of the Moon by 2024. This budget keeps us firmly on that path.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"We are preparing to achieve pivotal milestones this year in development of the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and the Gateway. These make up the backbone of our Artemis program and are fully supported by this budget. They constitute our ability to build a sustainable lunar presence and eventually send human missions to Mars.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Most noteworthy, is the President\\'s direct funding of more than $3 billion for the development of a human landing system. This is the first time we have had direct funding for a human lander since the Apollo Program. We are serious about our 2024 goals, and the President\\'s budget supports our efforts to get the job done.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"We soon will launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil for the first time in nearly a decade. This recaptured ability will not only allow us to do more science and more exploration than ever before, but will also broaden commercial activity in low-Earth orbit to support ever greater private partnerships.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"As we prepare to celebrate 20 years of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station this year, we will continue to look for ways to partner with private enterprise and give more people access to the unique environment microgravity offers. Similarly, when we go to the Moon in the next four years, we are interested in taking the world with us. This includes those involved in our Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative and the international relationships we have forged over the decades.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"The FY 2021 budget positions NASA to spearhead a new era of human space exploration without focusing funds on one program at the expense of others.

The popping sound of each laser zap will be recorded on Mars by a microphone installed along with SuperCam. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p><b>Laser Focus</b></p>\\n\\n<p>SuperCam is essentially a next-generation version of the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/\">Curiosity</a> rover\\'s ChemCam. Like its predecessor, SuperCam can use an infrared laser beam to heat the material it impacts to around 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (10,000 degrees Celsius) &mdash; a method called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy, or LIBS &mdash; and vaporizes it. A special camera can then determine the chemical makeup of these rocks from the plasma that is created.</p>\\n\\n<p>Just like ChemCam, SuperCam will use <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/2885/laser-targeting-ai-yields-more-mars-science/?site=msl\">artificial intelligence</a> to seek out rock targets worth zapping during and after drives, when humans are out of the loop. In addition, this upgraded A.I. lets SuperCam point very precisely at small rock features.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another new feature in SuperCam is a green laser that can determine the molecular composition of surface materials. This green beam excites the chemical bonds in a sample and produces a signal depending on which elements are bonded together &mdash; a technique called Raman spectroscopy. SuperCam also uses the green laser to cause some minerals and carbon-based chemicals to emit light, or fluoresce.</p>\\n\\n<p>Minerals and organic chemicals fluoresce at different rates, so SuperCam\\'s light sensor features a shutter that can close as quickly as 100 nanoseconds at a time &mdash; so fast that very few photons of light will enter it. Altering the shutter speed (a technique called time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy) will enable scientists to better determine the compounds present.</p>\\n\\n<p>Moreover, SuperCam can use visible and infrared (VISIR) light reflected from the Sun to study the mineral content of rocks and sediments. This VISIR technique complements the Raman spectroscopy; each technique is sensitive to different types of minerals.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24758/supercams-mast-unit-being-tested-at-los-alamos-national-laboratory/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\"SuperCam\\'s Mast Unit Being Tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24758_PIA23620-web.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>SuperCam\\'s Mast Unit Being Tested</b>: The Mast Unit for Mars 2020\\'s SuperCam, shown being tested here, will use a laser to vaporize and study rock material on the Red Planet\\'s surface.

In the late 1990s, the same design rode aboard the Mars Polar Lander, which crashed on the surface. In 2008, the Phoenix mission experienced electronics issues that prevented the microphone from being used.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the case of Mars 2020, SuperCam doesn\\'t have the only microphone aboard the rover: <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/#EDL-Cameras-Microphone\">an entry, descent and landing microphone</a> will capture all the sounds of the car-sized rover making its way to the surface.

The layers also can cause interference with radio communications by aircraft and shipping, and can blind military radar.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/internal_resources/details/original/848_Graphic_illustrating_radio_signals_from_a_remote_station_%28bent_purple_line%29_interfering_with_a_local_station_%28black_tower%29_after_being_reflected_off_a_plasma_layer_in_the_ionosphere..jpeg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Graphic illustrating radio signals from a remote station (bent purple line) interfering with a local station (black tower) after being reflected off a plasma layer in the ionosphere.\\' src=\\'/internal_resources/848\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nGraphic illustrating radio signals from a remote station (bent purple line) interfering with a local station (black tower) after being reflected off a plasma layer in the ionosphere.<br />\\nCredits: NASA Goddard/CI lab\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>At Earth, the layers form at an altitude of about 60 miles (approximately 100km) where the air is too thin for an aircraft to fly, but too thick for any satellite to orbit. The only way to reach them is with a rocket, but these missions last only tens of minutes before falling back to Earth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known they exist for over 80 years, but we know so little about what goes on inside them, because no satellite can get low enough to reach the layers,&rdquo; says Collinson, &ldquo;at least, no satellite at Earth&rdquo;.</p>\\n\\n<p>At Mars, spacecraft such as MAVEN can orbit at lower altitudes and can sample these features directly. MAVEN carries several scientific instruments that measure plasmas in the atmosphere and space around Mars. Recent measurements from one of these instruments detected unexpected sudden spikes in the abundance of plasma as it flew through the Martian ionosphere. Joe Grebowsky, former MAVEN project scientist at NASA Goddard, immediately recognized the spike from his previous experience with rocket flights through the layers at Earth. Not only had MAVEN discovered that such layers can occur at other planets than Earth, but the new results reveal that Mars offers what Earth cannot, a place where we can reliably explore these layers with satellites.</p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24756/artists-concept-of-maven-encountering-plasma-layers-at-mars/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Graphic illustrating the MAVEN spacecraft encountering plasma layers at Mars.\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24756_mavenatmars-web.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nGraphic illustrating the MAVEN spacecraft encountering plasma layers at Mars.<br />\\nCredits: NASA Goddard/CI lab<br />\\n<a href=\"/resources/24756/artists-concept-of-maven-encountering-plasma-layers-at-mars/\">Download image &rsaquo;</a>\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>&ldquo;The low altitudes observable by MAVEN will fill in a great gap in our understanding of this region on both Mars and Earth, with really significant discoveries to be had,&rdquo; says Grebowsky, a co-author on the paper.</p>\\n\\n<p>MAVEN observations are already overturning many of our existing ideas about the phenomena: MAVEN has discovered that the layers also have a mirror-opposite, a &ldquo;rift&rdquo;, where plasma is less abundant. The existence of such &ldquo;rifts&rdquo; in nature was completely unknown before their discovery at Mars by MAVEN, and overturns existing scientific models which say they cannot form. Additionally, unlike at Earth where the layers are short-lived and unpredictable, the Martian layers are surprisingly long-lived and persistent.</p>\\n\\n<p>These new discoveries already have given us a better understanding of the fundamental processes that underpin these layers, and future exploration at Mars will allow us to build better scientific models of how they form. While, much like the weather, we cannot stop them from forming, perhaps someday the new insights from Mars may help us to forecast them at Earth, meaning more reliable radio communication for us all.</p>\\n\\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission. MAVEN\\'s principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado\\'s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, and NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the MAVEN project. Partner institutions include Lockheed Martin, the University of California at Berkeley, and NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

High Bay 2 will be home to an Earth-science mission called <a href=\"https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/\">SWOT</a> before a mission to a metal asteroid, <a href=\"https://psyche.asu.edu/\">Psyche</a>, takes its place.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>What\\'s a Clean Room?</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the name implies, a clean room has to be pristine: Dust, hair, oils and other particulates in the air can interfere with electronics and moving parts. All efforts are made to keep bacteria to a minimum as well. Scientists don\\'t want to discover life only to find it was accidentally sent from Earth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"The whole idea of a clean room for spacecraft assembly comes out of the Ranger program,\" Conway said. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As pathfinders for the Apollo missions that followed, the nine Ranger missions were essentially unarmed missiles fired at the Moon. All but the first two were built in High Bay 1, back when it looked more like an aircraft hangar; engineers even smoked in it. The standards for manufacturing spacecraft were just being established. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sterilizing a spacecraft with heat appeared to fry Ranger 3\\'s electronics, causing it to miss the Moon by 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers). Debris floating inside Ranger 4 is believed to have led to its failure. Engineers began to realize that specialized clean rooms and cleaning processes were needed to build successful missions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24737/mariner-1-in-jpls-spacecraft-assembly-facility/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Mariner 1 in JPL\\'s Spacecraft Assembly Facility\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24737_PIA23310-16.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Mariner 1 in JPL\\'s Spacecraft Assembly Facility:</b> JPL\\'s Spacecraft Assembly Facility looks more like a hangar in this photo of two engineers standing with Mariner 1 on May 2, 1962. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/24737/mariner-1-in-jpls-spacecraft-assembly-facility/\" target=\"_blank\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a> \\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"When JPL started, we knew more about spacecraft than anybody else &mdash; and we knew nothing,\" said Arden Acord, a systems engineer who began working at JPL in 1971. \"We learned a lot of things along the way.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many of his first coworkers had built <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/wartime.php\">the Sergeant and Corporal missiles</a> when JPL was still a U.S. Army lab. Acord was a self-described long-haired hippie working alongside guys with crew cuts: \"It was a tough club to break into for a while. But eventually I became accepted.\" He went on to help build the twin Viking orbiters, which carried the first successful Mars landers, Voyager 1 and 2, and Galileo and Cassini.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Two Rooms for Earth and Beyond</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Almost all the spacecraft Acord worked on were built in High Bay 1, which in 1973 became what\\'s known as a Class 10,000 clean room. That means there are fewer than 10,000 particles of 0.5 microns or larger in size per cubic foot of air volume (0.5 microns is about 200 times smaller than the width of a human hair).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Opened in 1976, High Bay 2 is a Class 10,000 clean room as well.

Most metal is stainless steel, which resists corroding and releasing particles into the air.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Then there are the rigorous procedures required for everything that enters the clean room.  </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For spacecraft and their separate components, that means being wrapped in plastic and brought into an airlock outside the clean room. They\\'re unwrapped on the \"dirty side\" of the room and wiped down before being moved to the clean side. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A crane capable of lifting 30,000 pounds (13,608 kilograms) slides along the ceiling of each room, assisting workers as they move equipment through the high bays. A white parasol on each crane\\'s cable catches any grease or debris from the crane that could land on the sensitive hardware below. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Dressing the Part</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>People follow a special process before entering the clean room as well: Automated shoe brushes and sticky mats remove debris from their shoes before they enter a locker room. Once their feet are covered with booties, they step over a line onto the clean side of the room.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Then it\\'s time to don a bunny suit, face mask, hair cover and latex gloves before taping sleeves closed. (A mannequin called High Bay Bob stands on the floor of High Bay 1, demonstrating proper attire and giving visitors a sense of scale.) Finally, they step into an \"air shower\" that blows stray particles off the outside of their garments.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24739/ranger-7-in-safs-high-bay-1/\\' target=\\'_blank\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Ranger 7 in High Bay 1 on Dec. 10, 1963\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24739_PIA23520-NASA.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Ranger 7 in SAF\\'s High Bay 1: </b>High Bay 1 looks more like a modern clean room in this photo of Ranger 7 taken on Dec. 10, 1963, in JPL\\'s Spacecraft Assembly Facility.

Winds drive a series of processes in the atmosphere that can affect the propagation of radio waves, which are crucial for communications purposes for those on the surface, and the prediction of paths satellites will take in their orbit around Earth. Mapping Martian winds, therefore, is a crucial step towards understanding characteristics of extraterrestrial atmospheres beyond what we know about processes on Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Planetary atmospheres aren&rsquo;t static, and they certainly aren&rsquo;t uniform. To categorize where distinctive processes occur, the layers of atmospheres are differentiated based on temperature. For example, humans live in the lowest level: the troposphere. That&rsquo;s where weather happens, and temperature gets cooler at higher altitudes.</p>\\n\\n<p>The upper atmospheric winds on both Earth and Mars are in the planets&rsquo; respective thermospheres, which are areas where temperature increases with height. The measurements of winds that were recently mapped above Mars were found at an altitude range of about 140-240 kilometers (85-150 miles) above the planet&rsquo;s surface.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>MAVEN&rsquo;s journey</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The wind data has been gathered by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS). NGIMS&rsquo; original purpose was to determine the structure and composition of the Martian atmosphere by measuring in it the amounts of ions (electrically charged particles) and gases. However, although it was not originally designed to do so, in April 2016, the MAVEN team began using NGIMS to observe horizontal winds. Pausing normal collection of data, scientists on Earth programmed the instrument to nod back and forth so that it could detect the direction of winds along its track.</p>\\n\\n<p>By combining data from many tracks as MAVEN orbits Mars, scientists slowly built up a map of wind behavior. This led to a startling discovery: the wind patterns actually correlated with the Martian topography below.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Far above and down below</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Mars has tall mountains and steep valleys just as Earth does, and winds on the surface are forced above and around this topography.

Since the proton aurora is generated indirectly by hydrogen derived from Martian water that&rsquo;s in the process of being lost to space, this aurora could be used to help track ongoing Martian water loss.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;In this new study using MAVEN/IUVS data from multiple Mars years, the team has found that periods of increased atmospheric escape correspond with increases in proton aurora occurrence and intensity,&rdquo; said Andr&eacute;a Hughes of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Hughes is lead author of a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JA027140\" target=\"_blank\">paper on this research published December 12 in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Space Physics</a>. &ldquo;Perhaps one day, when interplanetary travel becomes commonplace, travelers arriving at Mars during southern summer will have front-row seats to observe Martian proton aurora majestically dancing across the dayside of the planet (while wearing ultraviolet-sensitive goggles, of course). These travelers will witness firsthand the final stages of Mars losing the remainder of its water to space.&rdquo; Hughes is presenting the research on December 12 at the <a href=\"https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting\" target=\"_blank\">American Geophysical Union meeting</a> in San Francisco. </p>\\n\\n<p>Different phenomena produce different kinds of aurora. However, all aurora at Earth and Mars are powered by solar activity, whether it be explosions of high-speed particles known as solar storms, eruptions of gas and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections, or gusts in the solar wind, a stream of electrically conducting gas that blows continuously into space at around a million miles per hour. For example, the northern and southern lights at Earth happen when violent solar activity disturbs Earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere, causing high velocity electrons to slam into gas particles in Earth&rsquo;s nightside upper atmosphere and make them glow. Similar processes generate Mars&rsquo; discrete and diffuse aurora &ndash; two types of aurora that were previously observed on the Martian nightside.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/21966/animation-of-proton-aurora-at-mars/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'This animation shows a proton aurora at Mars.

During southern summer on Mars, the planet is also near its closest distance to the Sun in its orbit and huge dust storms can occur. Summer warming and dust activity appear to cause proton auroras by forcing water vapor high in the atmosphere. Solar extreme ultraviolet light breaks the water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen is weakly bound by Mars&rsquo; gravity and enhances the hydrogen corona surrounding Mars, increasing hydrogen loss to space. More hydrogen in the corona makes interactions with solar-wind protons more common, making proton aurora more frequent and brighter.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;All the conditions necessary to create Martian proton aurora (<i>e.g.,</i> solar wind protons, an extended hydrogen atmosphere, and the absence of a global dipole magnetic field) are more commonly available at Mars than those needed to create other types of aurora,&rdquo; said Hughes. &ldquo;Also, the connection between MAVEN&rsquo;s observations of increased atmospheric escape and increases in proton aurora frequency and intensity means that proton aurora can actually be used as a proxy for what&rsquo;s happening in the hydrogen corona surrounding Mars, and therefore, a proxy for times of increased atmospheric escape and water loss.&rdquo; </p>\\n\\n<p>This research was funded by the MAVEN mission.

These regions near the poles have been studied by NASA\\'s Phoenix lander, which <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1756\" target=\"_blank\">scraped up ice</a>, and MRO, which has taken many images from space of <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/372/mro-sees-ice-on-mars-exposed-by-meteor-impacts/\">meteor impacts that have excavated this ice</a>.

Buried water ice changes the temperature of the Martian surface.

It\\'s also heavier, checking in at 2,260 pounds (1,025 kilograms), compared with Curiosity\\'s 1,982 pounds (899 kilograms). The weight difference has to do with the tools each carries.</p>\\n\\n<p>Start with the robotic arms: Curiosity\\'s extends 7 feet (2.2 meters) and wields a rotating 65-pound (30-kilogram) turret equipped with a scientific camera, chemical analyzer and drill. The roving science lab pulverizes rock samples and pours the powder into its chassis, where two laboratories can determine the rocks\\' chemical and mineral makeup.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars 2020\\'s arm has the same reach as Curiosity\\'s, but its turret weighs more &mdash; 99 pounds (45 kilograms) &mdash; because it carries larger instruments and a larger drill for coring. The drill will cut intact rock cores, rather than pulverizing them, and they\\'ll be placed in sample tubes via a complex storage system.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Eyes and Ears </b></p>\\n\\n<p>All of NASA\\'s Mars missions have allowed the public to ride along as scientists and engineers explore the planet. Curiosity has been doing that with 17 cameras on its Mast, or head, and body; four of them are color cameras.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars 2020 has 23 cameras, most of them color. The new rover also includes \"ears\" &mdash; two microphones to capture not only the first sounds of a Mars landing, but also Martian wind and the rover\\'s chemical-analyzing <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/supercam/\">laser zaps</a>. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/mastcam-z/\">Mastcam-Z</a>, an improved version of Curiosity\\'s Mast Camera, has a zoom capability and will take high-definition video and panoramas.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Wheels</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity has prepared Mars 2020\\'s team for \"off-roading\" on the Red Planet. When holes began appearing in the veteran rover\\'s aluminum wheels, engineers realized that sharp rocks cemented on the Martian surface exert more pressure on the wheels than expected. Careful drive planning, along with <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/2893/an-algorithm-helps-protect-mars-curiositys-wheels/?site=msl\">a software upgrade</a>, will keep them in shape for the rest of Curiosity\\'s journey up Mount Sharp.</p>\\n\\n<p>While <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/rover/wheels/\">Mars 2020\\'s wheels</a> are made from the same materials, they\\'re slightly bigger and narrower, with skins that are almost a millimeter thicker. Instead of Curiosity\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/rover/wheels/\">chevron-pattern treads</a>, or grousers, Mars 2020 has straighter ones and twice as many per wheel (48 versus 24). Extensive testing in JPL\\'s Mars Yard has shown these treads better withstand the pressure from sharp rocks but work just as well on sand.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Brains</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Mars rovers don\\'t drive themselves. Teams of scientists and engineers beam meticulously programmed task lists to them at the beginning of each Mars day, or sol. Rover drivers on Earth then wait for the vehicle to report back before planning the next drive. The more a rover can do on its own, the more time drivers have to program new commands.</p>\\n\\n<p>After Curiosity landed, it took an average of 19 hours for the rover\\'s team to analyze a day\\'s data, build and test commands, then send those commands back to the rover. Years of honing operations shrunk the time it takes to develop each day\\'s plan to seven hours, and a limited degree of auto-navigation has enabled Curiosity to take some cautious steps on its own.</p>\\n\\n<p>But Mars 2020 has even more self-driving smarts, allowing it to calculate a path five times faster than Curiosity can. That self-driving will be key to condensing the amount of time it takes for the 2020 team to plan each day\\'s operations. The new mission intends to eventually condense daily operations to just five hours. The faster pace will allow it to cover more ground and gather more samples over the course of its prime mission. Mars 2020 won\\'t move faster than its older sibling, but more automation means that it can potentially drive farther and collect more science without having to wait for engineers back on Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>The Landing</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity transformed Mars landings with the seemingly radical <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/timeline/entry-descent-landing/\">\"sky crane maneuver.\"</a> Mars 2020 will rely on the same process but also features an important new technology: <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8456/a-neil-armstrong-for-mars-landing-the-mars-2020-rover/\">Terrain Relative Navigation</a>. An onboard computer matches surface images from a camera to a map to keep the spacecraft on target.

While they also occur under normal conditions, the towers appear to form in greater numbers during global storms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A tower starts at the planet\\'s surface as an area of rapidly lifted dust about as wide as the state of Rhode Island. By the time a tower reaches a height of 50 miles (80 kilometers), as seen during the 2018 global dust storm, it may be as wide as Nevada. As the tower decays, it can form a layer of dust 35 miles (56 kilometers) above the surface that can be wider than the continental United States.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24705/a-mars-dust-tower-stands-out/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'\"Dust tower\" on Mars\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/24705_PIA23513-1000w.jpg\\'>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>A Mars Dust Tower Stands Out:</b> The yellow-white cloud in the bottom-center of this image is a Mars \"dust tower\" &mdash; a concentrated cloud of dust that can be lofted dozens of miles above the surface.

Though global dust storms cloak the planet\\'s surface, MRO can use its heat-sensing Mars Climate Sounder instrument to peer through the haze. The instrument is designed specifically for measuring dust levels. Its data, coupled with images from a camera aboard the orbiter called the Mars Context Imager (MARCI), enabled scientists to detect numerous swelling dust towers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>How Did Mars Lose Its Water?</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Dust towers appear throughout the Martian year, but MRO observed something different during the 2018 global dust storm. \"Normally the dust would fall down in a day or so,\" said the paper\\'s lead author, Nicholas Heavens of Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. \"But during a global storm, dust towers are renewed continuously for weeks.\" In some cases, multiple towers were seen for as long as 3 1/2 weeks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The rate of dust activity surprised Heavens and other scientists. But especially intriguing is the possibility that dust towers act as \"space elevators\" for other material, transporting them through the atmosphere. When airborne dust heats up, it creates updrafts that carry gases along with it, including the small quantity of water vapor sometimes seen as <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8442/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-finds-a-clay-cache/\">wispy clouds</a> on Mars. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A previous paper led by Heavens showed that during a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, water molecules were <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8299/dust-storms-linked-to-gas-escape-from-mars-atmosphere/\">lofted into the upper atmosphere</a>, where solar radiation could break them down into particles that escape into space. That might be a clue to how the Red Planet lost its lakes and rivers over billions of years, becoming the freezing desert it is today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Scientists can\\'t say with certainty what causes global dust storms; they\\'ve studied fewer than a dozen to date.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Global dust storms are really unusual,\" said Mars Climate Sounder scientist David Kass of JPL. \"We really don\\'t have anything like this on the Earth, where the entire planet\\'s weather changes for several months.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With time and more data, the MRO team hopes to better understand the dust towers created within global storms and what role they may play in removing water from the Red Planet\\'s atmosphere.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For more information about MRO:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/\"><b>mars.nasa.gov/mro/</b></a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html\"><b>www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html</b></a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr />\\r\\n<p><b>News Media Contacts</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span>Andrew Good</span><br />\\r\\n<span>Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</span><br />\\r\\n818-393-2433<br />\\r\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\\r\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\r\\n202-358-1501<br />\\r\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\r\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8558_PIA23513-32x24.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8558_PIA22487_main.gif', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8556, 'title': 'NASA Updates Mars 2020 Mission Environmental Review', 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': \"The electricity needed to operate NASA's Mars 2020 rover (pictured here) is provided by a power system called a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, or MMRTG.\", 'meta_author': '', 'byline': '', 'meta_keywords': '', 'item_name': '', 'updated_at': '2019-11-21T19:27:32.541Z', 'url': '/news/8556/nasa-updates-mars-2020-mission-environmental-review/', 'missions': [[175, 'mep', 'Mars Exploration Program'], [180, 'mars2020', 'Mars 2020 Rover']], 'news_type': [[165, 'feature', 'Feature Stories']], 'description': 'NASA and the Department of Energy have completed a more detailed risk analysis for the Mars 2020 rover launch from Florida.', 'date': 'November 21, 2019', 'body': '<p>As NASA continues preparations for the summer 2020 Florida launch of its Mars 2020 rover, including the recent completion of testing the spacecraft in Mars-like conditions, public safety remains a top priority.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Detailed analysis of the potential radiological risks associated with launching a spacecraft powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator is part of standard operating procedures for NASA missions like Mars Curiosity and Pluto New Horizons.

NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) have continued to evaluate the potential radiological impacts of the launch and have completed a more detailed risk analysis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On Oct. 25, that analysis and other updated information were released for public comment in a draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). The draft<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/news/newsroom/eis/\"> SEIS</a> is available now for public review and comment. Public meetings on the draft were held in the Cape Canaveral area and online during the week of Nov. 11.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The new analysis finds that the most probable outcome for Mars 2020 is a successful launch. An accident during launch is unlikely, and the estimated chance of an accident with a release of radiological material from the rover\\'s power system is small: 1 in 960 across all possible accident scenarios. In the case of a release, the resulting estimated maximum radiation dose for an exposed individual in the launch area who takes no protective actions would be low, equivalent to approximately eight months of natural background radiation for the average U.S. resident.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The launch period for the Mars 2020 mission opens on July 17, 2020. After the spacecraft lands on the Martian surface on Feb. 18, 2021, the rover will search for signs of past microbial life, characterize the planet\\'s climate and geology, and collect samples for future return to Earth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The system that provides electrical power for Mars 2020 and its scientific equipment is essentially a nuclear battery that uses the natural radioactive decay from plutonium dioxide as a heat source to produce power and warm internal systems. NASA has a long and successful record of performance with these power systems. The system on Mars 2020, known as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), is the same as the one on the Curiosity rover, which launched from Cape Canaveral in 2011 and continues to operate on Mars. Similar power systems have flown on more than two dozen U.S. space missions since 1961.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even though the chances of launch accidents are small, NASA prepares response plans for all of its launches to be ready to protect the public. To manage the response to an accident with a possible release of radioactive material in the launch area, NASA establishes an assessment and operations center staffed by a variety of subject matter experts that deploys monitoring devices and field teams equipped with specialized instruments prior to launch. NASA also assembles a multi-agency communications team that serves as a clearinghouse for timely and accessible information updates on accident conditions and any recommendations on precautionary measures.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The public comment period for the Mars 2020 draft SEIS is open through Dec. 10.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Steve Cole<br />\\r\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\r\\n202-358-0918</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"mailto:stephen.e.cole@nasa.gov\">stephen.e.cole@nasa.gov</a></p>\\r\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8556_PIA23305_320x240px.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8556_PIA23305-16.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8554, 'title': 'Two of a Space Kind: Apollo 12 and Mars 2020', 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': \"(Left) Apollo 12 astronaut Charles “Pete” Conrad Jr. stands beside NASA's Surveyor 3 spacecraft; the lunar module Intrepid can be seen in the distance.

Next July, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are launching rovers to Mars that will search for signs of past microbial life, and to find them, the scientists with NASA\\'s Mars 2020 mission and ESA\\'s ExoMars will need to examine different kinds of rocks that lend compelling insights into the environment in which they were made &mdash; all from 100 million miles away. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"While we expect to find many significant rocks during both Mars 2020 and ExoMars missions, we also have to leave open the possibility we could find one or more <i>very special</i> rocks<i>,</i> the kind whose discovery would not only speak volumes about the history of Mars but contribute significantly to the discussion of life elsewhere in the universe,\" said Ken Farley, Mars 2020 project scientist at Caltech in Pasadena.</p>\\n\\n<p>Guided by Martin Van Kranendonk, director of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology at the University of New South Wales, members of the two missions\\' science teams went on an expedition to northwestern Australia\\'s Pilbara region to analyze, discuss and debate stromatolites &mdash; structures preserved in rock that formed in water on early Earth and contain a fossilized record of ancient microbial life. Among the science teams\\' stops: a stromatolite cluster in a grouping of rock called the Dresser Formation that contains some of the oldest known fossilized records of life on our world.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Some 3.48 billion years ago, this area was home to a caldera, or collapsed volcano, filled with hot, bubbling seawater,\" said Van Kranendonk. \"At the same time, this location was also home to structures called microbial mats &mdash; visible to the naked eye but composed of microscopic organisms. Today you would know them as simple pond scum, but back then they were the most complex life forms on Earth.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Likely powered by photosynthesis, along with the heat and chemical energy in the caldera, these mats lived at the water\\'s edge, secreting a mucous that would trap grains of sediment swirling around in the water. Over time, sheet after sheet of these microbes trapped sediment on top of previous layers. When the seawater receded and the pond scum dried up and disappeared millennia later, what remained was striking evidence of this co-evolution of geology and biology.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"A stromatolite is quite subtle to the untrained eye,\" said Van Kranendonk. \"But once you know the details, you recognize that these wavy, wrinkly rocks have a structure different from that which can be explained by just geology.\"  </p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a href=\\'/resources/24695/researching-outback-stromatolites/\\' target=\\'_self\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Scientists from NASA\\'s Mars 2020 and ESA\\'s ExoMars projects study stromatolites, the oldest confirmed fossilized lifeforms on Earth, in the Pilbara region of North West Australia.

The conditions were ideal for stromatolites to form on the shorelines, which is one key reason the rover team will be touching down there in February 2021. \"It\\'s hard to think of a better recipe for life to thrive &mdash; and for its record to be preserved &mdash; than the one we see at Jezero,\" said Ken Williford, deputy project scientist for Mars 2020 at JPL.</p>\\n\\n<p>If stromatolites ever existed in Jezero or at Oxia Planum, the ExoMars landing site, the teams need to know what to look for, hence this trip to the Outback. But that\\'s not the only reason they came.     </p>\\n\\n<p>\"I organized this first joint Mars 2020-ExoMars science expedition so scientists from our two great missions could gain a new perspective on these one-of-a-kind stromatolites; a laboratory setting just can\\'t provide the same context,\" said Mitch Schulte, Mars 2020 program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"That applies to the experience as a whole, too &mdash; the conversations, comparing of notes and planning for future exchanges that was done here in the Pilbara will go a long way to advance Mars science.\" </p>\\n\\n<p><b>Two Missions, Two Rovers</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While the two missions both seek to find evidence of past life, each is approaching the challenge in its own way. Touching down about a week after Mars 2020, the ExoMars rover, otherwise known as the Rosalind Franklin<i>,</i> carries a core drill that on two or more occasions will bore almost 7 feet (2 meters) into the Martian crust. The rover will analyze the samples onsite with a sophisticated suite of scientific instruments. </p>\\n\\n<p>The coring mechanism on NASA\\'s Mars 2020 rover drills shallower holes but is designed to collect more than 40 rock and soil core samples. There will be on-site analysis of rocks at the coring sites, and the samples themselves will be sealed in metal tubes that will ultimately be deposited by the rover at specific sites. Future missions could then retrieve those samples and return them to Earth for the sort of laboratory analysis that just isn\\'t possible on Mars.  </p>\\n\\n<p>\"These two Mars missions will be revolutionary because they are complementary,\" said Teresa Fornaro, a science team member for the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer instrument aboard ExoMars. \"Two different rovers with two different sets of instruments, exploring at the same time two different landing sites. Some of the capabilities of Mars 2020 in characterizing the surface environment could help guide ExoMars on where to drill. Conversely, knowledge of the alteration of possible organics as a function of depth by ExoMars could help Mars 2020 select the most interesting surface samples to collect for future return to Earth.\"  </p>\\n\\n<p>When the joint Mars 2020-ExoMars science Outback expedition concluded in late August, the science teams went their separate ways. But to those who honed their stromatolite-hunting skills in the Pilbara, the influence of the trip continues. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"What is happening working out here in the field is also happening in the halls of NASA and ESA,\" said Schulte. \"Finding evidence of life on another world, if it ever existed, will require tenacity and a whole lot of brainpower. If there is a stromatolite in the range of the rovers, I think we have a good chance of finding it ... and we\\'ll find it together. This trip will have helped with that.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The launch window for Mars 2020 opens on July 17, 2020. It will land at Mars\\' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.

Atreya is a co-author of a paper on this topic published on November 12 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.</p>\\n\\n<p>As soon as scientists discovered the oxygen enigma, Mars experts set to work trying to explain it.

They considered the possibility that <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub>or water (H<sub><span>2</span></sub>O) molecules could have released oxygen when they broke apart in the atmosphere, leading to the short-lived rise. But it would take five times more water above Mars to produce the extra oxygen, and <span>CO</span><sub>2 </sub><span> </span>breaks up too slowly to generate it over such a short time. What about the oxygen decrease? Could solar radiation have broken up oxygen molecules into two atoms that blew away into space? No, scientists concluded, since it would take at least 10 years for the oxygen to disappear through this process.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re struggling to explain this,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/melissa.trainer\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Trainer</a>, a planetary scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland who led this research. &ldquo;The fact that the oxygen behavior isn&rsquo;t perfectly repeatable every season makes us think that it&rsquo;s not an issue that has to do with atmospheric dynamics. It has to be some chemical source and sink that we can&rsquo;t yet account for.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>To scientists who study Mars, the oxygen story is curiously similar to that of methane. Methane is constantly in the air inside Gale Crater in such small quantities (0.00000004% on average) that it&rsquo;s barely discernable even by the most sensitive instruments on Mars. Still, it&rsquo;s been measured by SAM&rsquo;s Tunable Laser Spectrometer. The instrument revealed that while methane rises and falls seasonally, it increases in abundance by about 60% in summer months for inexplicable reasons. (In fact, methane also <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8452/curiositys-mars-methane-mystery-continues/?site=msl\">spikes randomly and dramatically</a>. Scientists are trying to figure out why.)</p>\\n\\n<p>With the new oxygen findings in hand, Trainer&rsquo;s team is wondering if chemistry similar to what&rsquo;s driving methane&rsquo;s natural seasonal variations may also drive oxygen&rsquo;s. At least occasionally, the two gases appear to fluctuate in tandem.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning to see this tantalizing correlation between methane and oxygen for a good part of the Mars year,&rdquo; Atreya said. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s something to it. I just don&rsquo;t have the answers yet. Nobody does.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/internal_resources/details/original/839_Seasonal_Variations_in_Oxygen_and_Methane_at_Gale_Crater.jpeg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Seasonal Variations in Oxygen and Methane at Gale Crater\\' src=\\'/internal_resources/839\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Seasonal Variations in Oxygen and Methane at Gale Crater: </b>Methane and oxygen trends on Mars.

Scientists are considering all options, although they don&rsquo;t have any convincing evidence of biological activity on Mars. Curiosity doesn\\'t have instruments that can definitively say whether the source of the methane or oxygen on Mars is biological or geological. Scientists expect that non-biological explanations are more likely and are working diligently to fully understand them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Trainer&rsquo;s team considered Martian soil as a source of the extra springtime oxygen. After all, it&rsquo;s known to be rich in the element, in the form of compounds such as hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates. One experiment on the Viking landers showed decades ago that heat and humidity could release oxygen from Martian soil. But that experiment took place in conditions quite different from the Martian spring environment, and it doesn&rsquo;t explain the oxygen drop, among other problems. Other possible explanations also don&rsquo;t quite add up for now. For example, high-energy radiation of the soil could produce extra O<sub><span>2</span></sub> in the air, but it would take a million years to accumulate enough oxygen in the soil to account for the boost measured in only one spring, the researchers report in their paper.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'image_module right\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/3349_PIA00567.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Sunset at the Viking Lander 1 site, 1976.\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/3349_PIA00567.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Sunset at the Viking Lander 1 Site, 1976:</b> This color image of the Martian surface in the Chryse area was taken by Viking Lander 1, looking southwest, about 15 minutes before sunset on the evening of August 21.

The Viking experiments covered only a few Martian days, though, so they couldn&rsquo;t reveal seasonal patterns of the different gases. The new SAM measurements are the first to do so. The SAM team will continue to measure atmospheric gases so scientists can gather more detailed data throughout each season. In the meantime, Trainer and her team hope that other Mars experts will work to solve the oxygen mystery.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;This is the first time where we&rsquo;re seeing this interesting behavior over multiple years.

While modest, the movement is significant: Designed to dig as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground to gauge the heat escaping from the planet\\'s interior, the mole has only managed to partially bury itself since it started hammering in February 2019.</p>\\n\\n<p>The recent movement is the result of a new strategy, arrived at after extensive testing on Earth, which found that unexpectedly strong soil is holding up the mole\\'s progress. The mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to move: Without it, recoil from its self-hammering action will cause it to simply bounce in place. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8518/nasas-push-to-save-the-mars-insight-landers-heat-probe/?site=insight\">Pressing the scoop on InSight\\'s robotic arm</a> against the mole, a new technique called \"pinning,\" appears to provide the probe with the friction it needs to continue digging.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since Oct. 8, 2019, the mole has hammered 220 times over three separate occasions. Images sent down from the spacecraft\\'s cameras have shown the mole gradually progressing into the ground. It will take more time - and hammering - for the team to see how far the mole can go.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mole is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>, which was provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Seeing the mole\\'s progress seems to indicate that there\\'s no rock blocking our path,\" said HP<sup>3</sup> Principal Investigator Tilman Spohn of DLR. \"That\\'s great news! We\\'re rooting for our mole to keep going.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, leads the InSight mission. JPL has tested the robotic arm\\'s movement using full-scale replicas of InSight and the mole. Engineers continue to test what would happen if the mole were to sink beneath the reach of the robotic arm. If it stops making progress, they might scrape soil on top of the mole, adding mass to resist the mole\\'s recoil.</p>\\n\\n<p>If no other options exist, they would consider pressing the scoop down directly on the top of the mole while trying to avoid the sensitive tether there; the tether provides power to and relays data from the instrument.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The mole still has a way to go, but we\\'re all thrilled to see it digging again,\" said Troy Hudson of JPL, an engineer and scientist who has led the mole recovery effort. \"When we first encountered this problem, it was crushing.

Visible in the left foreground are two holes Curiosity drilled named \"Glen Etive 1\" (right) and \"Glen Etive 2\" (left) by the science team. The rover can analyze the chemical composition of rock samples by powderizing them with the drill, then dropping the samples into a portable lab in its belly called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM).</p>\\n\\n<p>About 984 feet (300 meters) behind the rover is Vera Rubin Ridge, which Curiosity <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8405/curiosity-says-farewell-to-mars-vera-rubin-ridge/?site=msl\">departed</a> nearly a year ago. Beyond the ridge, you can see the floor of Gale Crater and the crater\\'s northern rim. Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain inside the crater.</p>\\n\\n<p>The special chemistry experiment occurred on Sept. 24, 2019, after the rover placed the powderized sample from Glen Etive 2 into SAM. The portable lab contains 74 small cups used for testing samples. Most of the cups function as miniature ovens that heat the samples; SAM then \"sniffs\" the gases that bake off, looking for chemicals that hold clues about the Martian environment billions of years ago, when the planet was friendlier to microbial life.</p>\\n\\n<p>But nine of SAM\\'s 74 cups are filled with solvents the rover can use for special \"wet chemistry\" experiments. These chemicals make it easier for SAM to detect certain carbon-based molecules important to the formation of life, called organic compounds.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because there\\'s a limited number of wet-chemistry cups, the science team has been saving them for just the right conditions. In fact, the experiment at Glen Etive is only the second time Curiosity has performed wet chemistry since touching down on Mars in August 2012.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'ve been eager to find an area that would be compelling enough to do wet chemistry,\" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Now that we\\'re in the clay-bearing unit, we\\'ve finally got it.\" </p>\\n\\n<p>Clay-based rocks are good at preserving chemical compounds, which break down over time and when bombarded by radiation from space and the Sun. The science team is intrigued to see which organic compounds, if any, have been preserved in the rocks at Glen Etive. Understanding how this area formed will give them a better idea of how the Martian climate was changing billions of years ago.</p>\\n\\n<p>While this marks Curiosity\\'s second wet-chemistry experiment, it is the rover\\'s first on a drilled sample. In December 2016, when <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8314/curiosity-tests-a-new-way-to-drill-on-mars/?site=msl\">Curiosity\\'s drill malfunctioned</a>, the rover still had a bit of sand that had been scooped up in a place called \"Ogunquit Beach.\" It wasn\\'t a drilled sample, but the team wasn\\'t sure whether they\\'d get the drill working and be able to perform wet chemistry in the future. So they delivered the Ogunquit Beach sand into one of SAM\\'s wet chemistry cups since there was still science to be gained.</p>\\n\\n<p>Scientists consider Glen Etive a strategic location that will reveal more about how the clay-bearing unit formed. They built upon the valuable dress rehearsal at Ogunquit Beach to make adjustments that improved the recent experiment.</p>\\n\\n<p>The results will be known next year. \"SAM\\'s data is extremely complex and takes time to interpret,\" Mahaffy said. \"But we\\'re all eager to see what we can learn from this new location, Glen Etive.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><span>The individual images in this selfie were taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), a camera on the end of the rover\\'s robotic arm.

Based on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1960/mars-rover-curiosity-examines-possible-mud-cracks/?site=msl\">a series of mud cracks</a> at a location named \"Old Soaker,\" the team already knew the area had intermittent drier periods.

But the Sutton Island salts are different: For one thing, they\\'re mineral salts, not table salt. They\\'re also mixed with sediment, suggesting they crystallized in a wet environment &mdash; possibly just beneath evaporating shallow ponds filled with briny water.</p>\\n\\n<p>Given that Earth and Mars were similar in their early days, Rapin speculated that Sutton Island might have resembled saline lakes on South America\\'s Altiplano.

Looking across the entirety of Curiosity\\'s journey, which began in 2012, the science team sees a cycle of wet to dry across long timescales on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><span>\"As we climb Mount Sharp, we see an overall trend from a wet landscape to a drier one,\" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the Mars Science Laboratory mission that Curiosity is a part of. \"But that trend didn\\'t necessarily occur in a linear fashion. More likely, it was messy, including drier periods, like what we\\'re seeing at Sutton Island, followed by wetter periods, like what we\\'re seeing in the \\'clay-bearing unit\\' that Curiosity is exploring today.\"</span></p>\\n\\n<p>Up until now, the rover has encountered lots of flat sediment layers that had been gently deposited at the bottom of a lake. Team member Chris Fedo, who specializes in the study of sedimentary layers at the University of Tennessee, noted that Curiosity is currently running across large rock structures that could have formed only in a higher-energy environment such as a windswept area or flowing streams.</p>\\n\\n<p>Wind or flowing water piles sediment into layers that gradually incline. When they harden into rock, they become large structures similar to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8498/new-finds-for-mars-rover-seven-years-after-landing/?site=msl\">\"Teal Ridge,\"</a> which Curiosity investigated this past summer.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Finding inclined layers represents a major change, where the landscape isn\\'t completely underwater anymore,\" said Fedo. \"We may have left the era of deep lakes behind.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity has already spied more inclined layers in the distant sulfate-bearing unit. The science team plans to drive there in the next couple years and investigate its many rock structures. If they formed in drier conditions that persisted for a long period, that might mean that the clay-bearing unit represents an in-between stage &mdash; a gateway to a different era in Gale Crater\\'s watery history.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We can\\'t say whether we\\'re seeing wind or river deposits yet in the clay-bearing unit, but we\\'re comfortable saying is it\\'s definitely not the same thing as what came before or what lies ahead,\" Fedo said.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more about NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover mission, visit:</p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://nasa.gov/msl\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://nasa.gov/msl</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n', 'thumb': '/system/news_items/list_view_images/8522_PIA21261-320x240.jpg', 'main_image': '/system/news_items/main_images/8522_PIA21261_hires.jpg', 'status': 1}, {'id': 8520, 'title': \"NASA's Mars 2020 Rover Tests Descent-Stage Separation\", 'target': '_self', 'main_image_alt': 'Engineers and technicians working on the Mars 2020 spacecraft, look on as a crane lifts the rocket-powered descent stage away from the rover after a test.

InSight team engineer Ashitey Trebbi-Ollennu, based at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, explains what has been attempted and the game plan for the coming weeks. The next tactic they\\'ll try will be \"pinning\" the mole against the hole it\\'s in. Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'re going to try pressing the side of the scoop against the mole, pinning it to the wall of its hole,\" said InSight Deputy Principal Investigator Sue Smrekar of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might increase friction enough to keep it moving forward when mole hammering resumes.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Whether the extra pressure on the mole will compensate for the unique soil remains an unknown.</p>\\n\\n<p>Designed to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground to record the amount of heat escaping from the planet\\'s interior, the mole needs friction from surrounding soil in order to dig: Without it, recoil from the self-hammering action causes it to simply bounce in place, which is what the mission team suspects is happening now.</p>\\n\\n<p>While JPL manages the InSight mission for NASA, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) provided the heat probe, which is part of an instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>). Back in June, the team <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8445/insights-team-tries-new-strategy-to-help-the-mole/?site=insight\">devised a plan</a> to help the heat probe. The mole <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8444/common-questions-about-insights-mole/?site=insight\">wasn\\'t designed to be picked up</a> and relocated once it begins digging. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7259\">robotic arm</a> <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8455/nasas-insight-uncovers-the-mole/?site=insight\">removed a support structure</a> intended to hold the mole steady as it digs into the Martian surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>Removing the structure allowed the InSight team to get a better look at the hole that formed around the mole as it hammered. It\\'s possible that the mole has hit a rock, but testing by DLR suggested the issue was soil that clumps together rather than falling around the mole as it hammers. Sure enough, the arm\\'s camera discovered that below the surface appears to be 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of duricrust, a kind of cemented soil thicker than anything encountered on other Mars missions and different from the soil the mole was designed for.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"All we know about the soil is what we can see in images InSight sends us,\" said Tilman Spohn, HP<sup>3</sup>\\'s principal investigator at DLR. \"Since we can\\'t bring the soil to the mole, maybe we can bring the mole to the soil by pinning it in the hole.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Using a scoop on the robotic arm, the team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAInSight/status/1162419651139133440\" target=\"_blank\">poked and pushed</a> the soil seven times over the summer in an effort to collapse the hole. No such luck. It shouldn&rsquo;t take much force to collapse the hole, but the arm isn\\'t pushing at full strength. The team placed HP<sup>3</sup> as far from the lander as possible so that the spacecraft\\'s shadow wouldn\\'t influence the heat probe\\'s temperature readings. As a result, the arm, which wasn\\'t intended to be used this way, has to stretch out and press at an angle, exerting much less force than if the mole were closer.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'re asking the arm to punch above its weight,\" said Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, the lead arm engineer at JPL. \"The arm can\\'t push the soil the way a person can. This would be easier if it could, but that\\'s just not the arm we have.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Interplanetary rescue operations aren\\'t new to NASA. The Mars Exploration Rover team helped save Spirit and Opportunity on more than one occasion. Coming up with workable solutions requires an extraordinary amount of patience and planning. JPL has a working replica of InSight to practice arm movements, and it has a working model of the heat probe as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>Besides pinning, the team is also testing a technique to use the scoop in the way it was originally intended to work: scraping soil into the hole rather than trying to compress it. Both techniques might be visible to the public in <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/multimedia/raw-images/\">raw images</a> that come down from InSight in the near future.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

Granted, you\\'ll need superhuman hearing, but NASA\\'s InSight lander comes equipped with a very special \"ear.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The spacecraft\\'s exquisitely sensitive seismometer, called the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure</a> (SEIS), can pick up vibrations as subtle as a breeze. The instrument was provided by the French space agency, Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES), and its partners.</p>\\n\\n<p>SEIS was designed to listen for marsquakes. Scientists want to study how the seismic waves of these quakes move through the planet\\'s interior, revealing the deep inner structure of Mars for the first time.</p>\\n\\n<p>But after the seismometer was <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8407/insights-seismometer-now-has-a-cozy-shelter-on-mars/?site=insight\">set down by InSight\\'s robotic arm</a>, Mars seemed shy. It didn\\'t produce its first rumbling until <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8430/nasas-insight-detects-first-likely-quake-on-mars/?site=insight\">this past April</a>, and this first quake turned out to be an odd duck. It had a surprisingly high-frequency seismic signal compared to what the science team has heard since then. Out of more than 100 events detected to date, about 21 are strongly considered to be quakes. The remainder could be quakes as well, but the science team hasn\\'t ruled out other causes.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Quakes</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Put on headphones to listen to two of the more representative quakes SEIS has detected. These occurred on May 22, 2019 (the 173rd Martian day, or sol, of the mission) and July 25, 2019 (Sol 235). Far below the human range of hearing, these sonifications from SEIS had to be speeded up and slightly processed to be audible through headphones. Both were recorded by the \"very broad band sensors\" on SEIS, which are more sensitive at lower frequencies than its short period sensors.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Sol 173 quake is about a magnitude 3.7; the Sol 235 quake is about a magnitude 3.3.</p>\\n\\n<p><span><b>Quake Sol 173</b>: </span><div class=\\'audio_embed column-width\\'>\\n<audio controls> <source src=\"/system/internal_resources/details/original/834_Quake_Sol_173.wav\" type=\"audio/wav\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Quake Sol 235:</b><span> <div class=\\'audio_embed column-width\\'>\\n<audio controls> <source src=\"/system/internal_resources/details/original/835_Quake_Sol_235.wav\" type=\"audio/wav\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>\\n</div></span></p>\\n\\n<p>Each quake is a subtle rumble. The Sol 235 quake becomes particularly bass-heavy toward the end of the event. Both suggest that the Martian crust is like a mix of the Earth\\'s crust and the Moon\\'s. Cracks in Earth\\'s crust seal over time as water fills them with new minerals. This enables sound waves to continue uninterrupted as they pass through old fractures. Drier crusts like the Moon\\'s remain fractured after impacts, scattering sound waves for tens of minutes rather than allowing them to travel in a straight line. Mars, with its cratered surface, is slightly more Moon-like, with seismic waves ringing for a minute or so, whereas quakes on Earth can come and go in seconds.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mechanical Sounds and Wind Gusts</b></p>\\n\\n<p>SEIS has no trouble identifying quiet quakes, but its sensitive ear means scientists have lots of other noises to filter out. Over time, the team has learned to recognize the different sounds. And while some are trickier than others to spot, they all have made InSight\\'s presence on Mars feel more real to those working with the spacecraft.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s been exciting, especially in the beginning, hearing the first vibrations from the lander,\" said Constantinos Charalambous, an InSight science team member at Imperial College London who works with the SP sensors. \"You\\'re imagining what\\'s really happening on Mars as InSight sits on the open landscape.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Charalambous and Nobuaki Fuji of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris provided the audio samples for this story, including the one below, which is also best heard with headphones and captures the array of sounds they\\'re hearing.  </p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\'column-width embedded_video video_player_container\\'>\\n<div class=\\'video_wrapper\\'>\\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9cCuW9nIQg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Listen to NASA\\'s InSight at Work on Mars</b>: NASA\\'s InSight lander placed a seismometer on the Martian surface to study marsquakes.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p>On March 6, 2019, a camera on InSight\\'s robotic arm was scanning the surface in front of the lander. Each movement of the arm produces what to SEIS is a piercing noise.</p>\\n\\n<p>Wind gusts can also create noise. The team is always on the hunt for quakes, but they\\'ve found the twilight hours are one of the best times to do so. During the day, sunlight warms the air and creates more wind interference than at night.</p>\\n\\n<p>Evening is also when peculiar sounds that the InSight team has nicknamed \"dinks and donks\" become more prevalent. The team knows they\\'re coming from delicate parts within the seismometer expanding and contracting against one another and thinks heat loss may be the factor, similar to how a car engine \"ticks\" after it\\'s turned off and begins cooling.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can hear a number of these dinks and donks in this next set of sounds, recorded just after sundown on July 16, 2019 (Sol 226).

The 2,300-pound (1,040-kilogram) Martian vehicle was rotated clockwise and counterclockwise at about 1 revolution per minute on what is called a spin table in the clean room of the Spacecraft Assembly Facility at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. (The rotation was speeded up in the video above.) The engineers were looking for the rover\\'s center of gravity, or the point at which weight is evenly dispersed on all sides.</p>\\n\\n<p>Establishing the rover\\'s center of gravity is a key part of the assembly process and helps ensure that the spacecraft travels smoothly from launch to entry, descent and landing on Mars as calculated. Engineers can add weights in order to help balance out the vehicle. In the end, they affixed nine tungsten weights totaling 44 pounds (20 kilograms) to the rover chassis at predetermined attachment points to get the center of gravity just right.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The spin table process is similar to how a gas station would balance a new tire before putting it on your car,\" said Lemil Cordero, Mars 2020 mass properties engineer at JPL. \"We rotate the rover back and forth and look for asymmetries in its mass distribution. Then, similar to your gas station putting small weights on the tire\\'s rim to bring it into balance, we\\'ll put small balance masses on the rover in specific locations to get its center of gravity exactly where we want it.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This was the assembled rover\\'s first spin table test to determine its center of gravity; a second and final spin table test will occur at a NASA facility at Cape Canaveral in Florida next spring.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover for NASA.
